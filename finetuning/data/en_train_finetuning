dpa: iraqi authorities announced that had busted up 3 terrorist cells operating in baghdad.
wonder if was manipulating the market with his bombing targets.
although the announcement was probably made to show progress in identifying and breaking up terror cells, do n't find the news that the baathists continue to penetrate the iraqi government very hopeful.
reminds me too much of the arvn officers who were secretly working for the other side in vietnam.
on wednesday guerrillas had kidnapped a cosmetic surgeon and his wife while were on their way home.
in suwayrah, kut province, two car bombs were discovered before could be detonated.
the commission said had no legal grounds for such an exclusion.
but in my view is highly significant.
is no longer in the dominant shiite list, the united iraqi alliance, and wo n't have many seats in the new parliament.
some 2,000 junior officers of the old baath army have been recalled to duty in recent months, something chalabi would have blocked if could have.
if or she did not, then should have all the same rights as other iraqis.
a team from the court managed to take his deposition before died.
baghdadis do n't venture much out of their neighbourhoods any more, never know where might get stuck.
fedayeen are now visible on the street and have become bolder than ever.
yesterday there were tens of them putting road blocks on our street and setting up mortars, only come out in the open when americans leave the area, then start firing mortars indiscriminately and shooting their ak-47's in the air.
are setting the road blocks at the exact same positions were during the war last year, which indicates are the same people.
and there is nothing can do about it really, people who are suggesting that go out and fight them are living in dream land.
most people have n't gone to work the last few days, although seems that the rest of baghdad is 'normal' (if can define what normal is).
there are rumours about preparations by slum dwellers for another looting spree against banks, governmental and public property similar to the one that took place last april, and have already overheard youngsters in my neighbourhood joking about it and saying things like "this time will be the first to loot, did n't get anything the last time".
what irritates me is this sudden false 'solidarity' between sunni and shi'ite clerics, all know that would be glad to get at each other s throats when have the chance, and shia clerics were describing fallujan insurgents as 'ba'athists', 'saddamites', 'wahhabis', and 'terrorists' just a few days ago.
guess 's just the old new arab 'me against my brother, me and my brother against my cousin, me and my cousin against my enemy', or 'the enemy of my enemy is my friend' thing going on again.
speaking of fallujah, have only al-jazeera to rely on for our news from there.
have sent over their top reporter ahmed mansour to the town, and is spouting all kinds of propaganda hourly reminding me of al-sahhaf.
"they are targetting ambulances", "american snipers are shooting children and pregnant women", and " are using cluster bombs against civilians" is all get to hear from him.
did once make an unforgivable error when mentioned that fallujan militants were shooting at the marines from the roofs of mosques and houses in hay al-golan, but of course that is okay for al-jazeera.
azzaman newspaper mentioned an announcement signed by abdul aziz bin muqrin, an al-qaeda operative in saudi arabia on an islamic website 'the voice of jihad', in which stated that "although mutilating dead bodies is not originally permitted in islam, but in this case is allowed if muslims use it against infidels to deter them from committing criminal actions".
added that "america does not understand anything except the language of force and retaliation, were kicked out of somalia in humiliation after that soldier was dragged in mogadishu for the whole world to see", and that "the day will come when the dead bodies of americans and jews would be dragged, defiled, and stepped on in the arabian peninsula together with their agents and supporters".
now can tour chernobyl and write your own story.
is a time to learn what happened and how may affect the future.
as a parent, can well imagine how painful must be for those families whose children are succumbing to radiation poisoning.
would be interested in hearing what conclusions reached and what found that was most convincing.
as a child in the 50's had a lot of glandular problems and treated it with radiation therapy (primitive at best!) and stopped when a lesion on my neck started enlarging-- said was not ca but stopped the treatments....
the urge to protect and gather them all in is almost overwhelming, and makes me more grateful for the blessings have.
'm sorry to say elena 's story has been revealed to be a fake.
if al-qaeda can kill musharraf or instigate a military coup against him by islamist junior officers, can hope to catapult the mma to power as political allies and hosts.
would thereby gain control of a major base for terrorist operations, which is also a nuclear power.
but so was unlikely that a small group of arab mujahidin would virtually take over afghanistan.
response: the us must do whatever can to strengthen the legitimacy of the pakistani government.
should continue to be defanged.
response: iraq is actually hostile territory for al-qaeda, and without iraqi sympathizers can not succeed there.
by moving quickly to iraqi sovereignty and improvement of iraqi lives, the us may be able to get iraqis on its side, so that turn in the foreigners.
need an fdr in iraq, not a ronald reagan.
the thing to keep in mind is that sunni arab nationalists and baathists and local sunni radicals are likely to remain far more dangerous to the us in iraq than al-qaeda infiltrators, and would be dangerous to take one 's eyes off the former ball.
the problem with this argument is that bush lacked the experience necessary to be president when ran in 2000, so this sort of cheap shot just hoists him by his own petard.
could not name the others.
"can name the general who is in charge of pakistan?"
hiller replied: "no, 's four questions of four leaders in four hot spots." . . .
bush, in answering the question about the leader of pakistan, also said: "the new pakistani general, 's just been elected -- not elected, this guy took over office.
appears this guy is going to bring stability to the country and think that 's good news for the subcontinent."
" find troubling that a candidate for president in our country -- the world 's oldest democracy -- would characterize the military takeover as "good news," gore said.
"further, find even more disturbing that made these comments about a nation that just last year tested nuclear weapons -- shortly after voicing his public opposition to the comprehensive test ban treaty.
" is very dangerous for this country to condone the overthrow of democratically elected governments," said david leavy, spokesman for the national security council.
musharraf made his coup in part because of the military 's anger over prime minister nawaz sharif 's willingness to back down from confronting india over kashmir, so that explicitly came to power as a warmonger.
ca n't tell you how ominous found bush 's performance in that interview.
still remember him stuttering about "the general," unable to remember musharraf 's name.
obviously had no idea what was talking about, though demonstrated a number of ill-fated instincts.
and, did n't think needed to know anything about south asia, with its nuclear giants and radical religious politics--the latter a dire security threat to the us.
could n't tell when things were becoming more unstable as opposed to less.
so, one answer to bush 's charge about edwards is that if had any merit, bush should have declined to run himself.
do n't see bush doing any of this.
have, however, actually weakened israeli security?
at some points, as in the late 1980s, reportedly made behind-the-scenes overtures to the israelis to arrive at some sort of a deal.
did not allow palestinian radicals to launch operations against israel from iraq.
if is hard to see how baathist iraq posed any real threat to israel, is not so difficult to see a menace in the current instability.
vehemently protested the israeli assassination of sheikh ahmed yassin, the leader of hamas, last march.
have also reestablished their historical links with lebanese and iranian shiites.
is inevitable that most iraqi shiites will side with their hizbullah coreligionists against israel, and seems likely that iraqi shiites will get rich enough from iraqi petroleum sales in the future that will be in a good position to bankroll lebanese shiite radicals.
whereas saddam hussein 's dictatorship ensured that such populist currents were kept firmly under control, are now free to organize.
apart from the 1,200 indian lives lost in 1987, the indian peacekeeping force was immensely unpopular not only in tamil nadu and the jaffna peninsula but also among the sinhalese majority who considered a violation of their country 's sovereignty.
while india is ready to enter into a "defense cooperation agreement" with sri lanka, is wary of being drawn into any military involvement in the island nation 's two decades-old civil war that has seen violent strife between ethnic tamils and the sinhalese majority - leaving over 60,000 dead on both sides.
for that reason, said, kumaratunga 's government was keen to beef up military preparedness with indian support.
and the tigers look as if are on the brink of launching another offensive," muni told ips.
but, too, failed.
"the norwegians mean well but their role is limited to that of honest broker and the ltte is keenly aware that do not have the power [unlike india] to underwrite any arrangement," kalkat told ips in an interview.
complained about the "visible lack of progress" and reaching an impasse in talks with both sides.
added that recent visits to the island by india 's top military brass including army chief general nirmal chander vij have "caused apprehension among tamils that preparations are under way for another war in the island".
in any case, kalkat puts succinctly: "there can not be a military option to what is a political situation."
while most u.s. secretaries of state -- save perhaps dean rusk -- have gobbled up credit for outcomes that had little to do with, few have been as brazen as colin powell.
as pakistan 's president had been telling the united states was "forced" into taking a hawkish line on india precisely by the likes of rahman, this was an embarrassment.
india keeps what has while pakistan and china (which was gifted a slice of the territory three decades ago) do likewise.
is also far more than what any administration in new delhi can deliver.
unfortunately for them, the general has decided to take seriously colin powell 's frequent boasts that was on his nudging that the indians made conciliatory gestures toward islamabad.
was the business community in india that stepped in after vajpayee indulged in an empty bout of saber rattling in 2002, pointing out that the only beneficiary of the mythical perception that war -- especially nuclear war -- was around the corner in the subcontinent was china.
the one country that has shown that understands the realities in south asia is china.
all know that john kerry served in vietnam.
four whole months, after which took advantage of a little-known, little-invoked regulation that allowed him to desert his "band of brothers".
also know how dan rather libeled george bush and impugned his service in the texas air national guard on a "60 minutes ii" report based largely on forged documents.
as far as george bush knew, and his unit could have been transferred to vietnam.
do n't let just anybody do it.
some reporters ( know, the ones with journalistic ethics) have actually uncovered the truth about george bush 's service in the texas air national guard.
for example, did know that george bush spent considerably more time in uniform than john kerry?
before fall for dems’ spin, here are the facts
what do really know about george w. bush ’s time in the air national guard?
that did n’t show up for duty in alabama?
almost immediately, began an extended period of training.
was full-time work.
by the time was over, bush had served nearly two years.
as did, accumulated points toward his national guard service requirements.
according to records released earlier this year, bush earned 253 points in his first year, may 1968 to may 1969 (since joined in may 1968, his service thereafter was measured on a may-to-may basis).
earned 137 points in 1970-1971.
and earned 112 points in 1971-1972.
the numbers indicate that in his first four years, bush not only showed up, showed up a lot.
did know that?
in fact, were helping them solve their problem.”
from may 1972 to may 1973, earned just 56 points — not much, but enough to meet his requirement.
then, in 1973, as bush made plans to leave the guard and go to harvard business school, again started showing up frequently.
in june and july of 1973, accumulated 56 points, enough to meet the minimum requirement for the 1973-1974 year.
then, at his request, was given permission to go.
by that time, however, had accumulated enough points in each year to cover six years of service.
now, is only natural that news reports questioning bush ’s service — in the boston globe and the new york times, on cbs and in other outlets — would come out now.
and, as is with kerry, ’s reasonable to look at a candidate ’s entire record, including his military service — or lack of it.
voters are perfectly able to decide whether ’s important or not in november.
the kerry camp blames bush for the swift boat veterans’ attack, but anyone who has spent much time talking to the swifties gets the sense that are doing it entirely for their own reasons.
in april — before the swift boat veterans had said a word — kerry said bush “has yet to explain to america whether or not, and tell the truth, about whether showed up for duty.”
earlier, kerry said, “just because get an honorable discharge does not, in fact, answer that question.”
should know as much as can.
suspect the streets of baghdad will look as if a war is looming this week.
there is no doubt that many iraqis regard the date of 30 january as a day of renewed hope, one have been awaiting all their lives, but at the same time, many others are already dreading it.
the interim government has promised security measures that would reduce the violence on the day of elections, but fail to see how will be able to protect all 5,000 (or so) balloting centres.
again there is no official written statement from sistani 's office confirming this allegation, which think is intentional.
one remark made by sha'lan on al-arabiya tv, that could n't say more about chalabi because would embarrass himself and the viewers almost made roll on the floor.
even there, many kurds look and act as if are going to grab the chance to vote them out of power.
doubt that will be the outcome though.
its support base is much larger than what seems.
had an interesting conversation with a middle-aged taxi driver who used to live in fallujah and is now at relatives in amiriya, baghdad.
after asking me which tribe belong to (thus assessing my sectarian background) started hurling abuses at the shia, calling them persians, majoos (fire worshippers), rabid dogs and a handful of other descriptions that ca n't mention here.
described allawi 's face as that of a f*ed horse and dismissed the whole government as a band of thieves and traitors.
said that resistance was the only commonsense solution.
leaving aside the fact that this views conflicts with other historical examples in the region, sunnis have never offered an alternative choice, which eventually leads one to guess that the opinion held by the fallujan taxi driver above is precisely what are planning to implement.
had another conversation some months ago with a retired ba'athist old-timer who claimed that ba'athists have the means to stage a third coup d'etat and return to power within 10 hours of an american withdrawal.
on sensing my incredulity to his statement asserted that ba'athist cells exist in all parts of the country and that do have a central command, even though many have formed seperate cells (often under islamic labels) with their own leaderships.
said that have the training and the funding as well as the support of neighbouring and regional governments.
concur that ba'athists and former security forces are capable of immediately controlling at least 5 out of 18 governorates, along with the capital, if americans are to be removed from the picture entirely.
but also see that as a fatal misconception, which is doing sunnis harm, because do n't believe the us is going anywhere so soon.
any government that assumes power after the elections also realises this, so not even sistani is going to call the us to withdraw its troops, despite what is saying now, not until are ensured the insurgency is out of the picture, or that have an alternative foreign power (in this case iran) to back them up.
would suggest going for tribal sheikhs rather than clerics, since have the upper hand in their areas and can effectively root out any ba'athists in their midst in return for a promise of sharing power and authority.
believe national reconciliation to be the only path forward to a new iraq.
("at first hid a lot.
thought the us government was looking for me.
now hide a lot less.")
as recently as last week the official line stated had no knowledge had entered the country.
and though 'd been a faithful servant, was not such a player that could get away with that.
should have taken a cue from another bomber some pesky dark-skinned foreigners want extradited, cia operative michael meiring.
happened in the philippines which, like pakistan, is an important and vulnerable node for the business which intelligence agencies and terrorist organizations conduct with each other.
expect will be determined that, under "strong man" hugo chavez, posada could not be guaranteed a fair trial.
seem to recall the object was to smuggle explosives.
needed someone that could convince the jury had been able to see all relevant documents in cia files on wilson.
wilson was claiming that had been working for the cia when sold the c-4 to quaddaffi.
the prosecution was charging was a rogue using his contacts from former service in both cia and the 'office of naval intelligence'.
wilson had been able to show that 'd had more than 80 "non-social contacts" with the cia since his retirement in 1971, leaving the prosecution 's case in turmoil.
third ranking cia officer, briggs signed a declaration on february 3rd, 1983, that on november 8th, 1982, had authorized a search of cia records "for any material that in any way pertains to edwin p. wilson, or the various allegations concerning his activities after february 28th, 1971, when retired from the cia."
looks like is rearing its head again in louisianna..
police said bernard confessed to detectives that had sex with a young girl in november 2002 and admitted to knowing about sexual acts involving children and a dog that occurred at hosanna church.
have a similar case unravelling up here in the northwest with a murder of a family and missing children taken for some purpose.
if was rummy 'd send posada to iraq to blow things up there.
now that 's a post can relate to.

is likely, but not certain, that will be deported to myanmar.
but the news of the arakan rebels is just the tip of the iceberg when comes to growing concern in new delhi over the security of the andaman islands.
has also become an arms depot of the liberation tigers of tamil eelam (ltte), who operate almost freely in the andaman sea.
correspondents who flocked in to cover the tsunami found also had another story - the miserable security situation surrounding the indian navy 's far eastern naval command, now being established along with india 's "blue water navy".
security problems in the andaman sea are not new, but have deteriorated during the past few years, in tandem with a deterioration in the security situation in bangladesh, nepal and bhutan, and particularly in the northeastern indian states of manipur, nagaland and tripura.
while the indian army has become rock-solid in the western front, and has developed the capability of withstanding any pakistani adventure in that sector, has become highly vulnerable in its eastern sector, where its enemy is not a national army but a multitude of secessionist, terrorist and drug-running militants operating between southeast asia and northeastern india through bangladesh.
since the "sea tigers" of the ltte, better known as the tamil tigers, are the ones who rule the andaman sea: carry the arms and drugs for their own use and also to deliver to rebels in aceh and all along the east coast of africa.
is old news that the tamil tigers have developed a strong network within south africa.
"port blair, havelock islands, diglipur, middle nicobar, campbell 's bay, neil islands and rangott are mostly overrun by foreigners," said.
as most of them have few technical skills, and the andamans have little demand for them in any case, turn to smuggling and other unlawful activities.
reports from port blair make evident that new delhi gets little on-the-ground intelligence, and the indian coast guard is grossly unequipped to deal with the surge of illegal migrants to the islands.
considering the islands' huge strategic importance, is amazing how lax new delhi has been.
unless new delhi does better in providing security to its own nationals against rebels, secessionists, drug runners and arms traffickers, will not generate much confidence in the capitals of surrounding nations.
in fact, would tend to encourage more organized anti-india outfits, such as the pakistani inter-services intelligence (isi) and outside-linked maoists, to exploit these networks and weaken india 's eastern flank.
is widely acknowledged that the pakistani isi has nurtured a number of extremist islamist groups, such as the harkat-ul-jehad-al-islami, in the port city of chittagong, and put a number of secessionist rebels from india 's northeast in touch with this terrorist network.
a pattern of arrests and seizures indicate that arms are brought by the ltte from laos, cambodia and thailand into chittagong, from where are transported northward by land to bhutan.
stretching 750 kilometers from end to end, reach from near the coast of myanmar almost to sumatra in indonesia.
travel to the nicobar islands is forbidden to non-indians, and are also not allowed in some parts of south andaman island.
also writes for aakrosh, india 's defense-tied quarterly journal.
“there have no business being there unless are undermining pakistan,’’ says a pakistani official.
‘’should pakistan show us any evidence of an indian hand using afghan soil to work against our neighbours will take very seriously,” says amrullah saleh the head of afghanistan ’s national security directorate. ]
the neighbours are still interfering, but there are signs that rather than undermining afghanistan ’s stability may now be trying to strengthen it.
‘’ was the first time that bush totally focused on the taliban threat rather than al qaeda with the pakistanis,’’ says a western diplomat.
until then had said pakistan ’s options were open.
us and nato military officers in kabul say is too early to say whether bush ’s tough message was instrumental in persuading musharraf and the isi to pressure the taliban to restrain from disrupting the elections.
‘’there is much better tactical cooperation between our forces on both sides of the border, but the movement of taliban still goes on both ways,’’ adds.
until now pakistan has not facilitated such a return and clearly can not happen until there is both a pull from kabul and a push from islamabad.
with president karzai certain to win the elections and the demotion of key former northern alliance figures such as general fahim and warlord ismail khan, there is now little reason for moderate taliban leaders to fear reprisals from former northern alliance figures if return home.
“ have no business being there unless are undermining pakistan,’’ says a pakistani official.
‘’should pakistan show us any evidence of an indian hand using afghan soil to work against our neighbours will take very seriously,” says amrullah saleh the head of afghanistan ’s national security directorate.
karzai categorically said that has assured musharraf repeatedly that any adverse action against pakistan taken by indian diplomats inside afghanistan would be acted upon swiftly.
iranian officials say made no objections to khan ’s ouster because want to strengthen karzai ’s campaign against warlords.
‘’ have a very small number of forces in shindand with a few helicopters,’’ says barno.
nevertheless this places karzai in a difficult and sensitive situation because has to maintain excellent relations with both the us and iran.
so far what have done together has been good for us and that ’s how would like to keep it’’, says karzai.
in the post election scenario is becoming abundantly clear that the taliban do not have the support of the afghan people nor the afghan pashtuns.
is now abundantly clear that with the rapidly changing face of afghanistan, the demise of key northern alliance figures and the fluid political situation in afghanistan, pakistan should reconsider its policy of giving unlimited sanctuary to taliban extremists living on pakistani soil.
the charges that have put some vets up to making against kerry are false and can be demonstrated by the historical record to be false .
or were n't eyewitnesses and are just lying.
has never lived in a war zone.
was drinking.
was drinking like a fish, every night, into the wee hours.
gave no service to anyone, risked nothing, and did not even slack off efficiently.
the history of alcoholism and possibly other drug use is a key issue because not only speaks to bush 's character as an addictive personality, but may tell us something about his erratic and alarming actions as president.
clearly enjoyed, as governor, watching executions.
his delight in killing people became a campaign issue in 2000 when seemed, in one debate, to enjoy the prospect of executing wrong-doers a little too much.
has clearly gone on enjoying killing people on a large scale in iraq.
that managed to get on the wagon (though with that pretzel incident, wonder how firmly) is laudable.
but suffers the severe effects of the aftermath, and are all suffering along with him now, since is the most powerful man in the world.
all know by now that bush did not even do his full service with the texas air national guard, absenting himself to work on the alabama senate campaign of winton "red" blount.
whether was actually awol during this stint is unclear.
but is clear that not only did bush slack off on his national guard service, but slacked off from his campaign work.
this little-noted interview with blount 's nephew murph archibald, which appeared on national public radio 's "all things considered on march 30, 2004, gives a devastating insight into what was like to have to suffer through bush in that period.
for weeks, reporters scoured alabama in search of pilots or anyone who might have remembered seeing mr. bush at the time was serving in the national guard there.
president bush has always said that working for blount was the reason transferred to the alabama air national guard.
groom was republican red blount 's scheduler, and in that job, was the hub in the campaign wheel.
ask her about the handsome young man from texas, and remembers him 32 years later like was yesterday.
would wear khaki trousers and some old jacket.
was always ready to go out on the road.
on the phone, could hear his accent.
was a texas accent.
but just melded with everybody.
was mr. bush 's job to organize the republican county chairpersons in the 67 alabama counties.
was the young texan 's job to find out what each county leader needed in the way of campaign supplies and get those supplies to them.
. . . murph archibald is red blount 's nephew by marriage, and in 1972, was coming off a 15-month tour in vietnam in the infantry.
mr. murph archibald (nephew of red blount): well, was coming in early in the morning and leaving in mid-evenings.
ordinarily, george would come in around noon; would ordinarily leave around 5:30 or 6:00 in the evening.
goodwyn: archibald says that two months before the election, in september of '72, red blount 's campaign manager came to him and asked that quietly take over mr. bush 's job because the campaign materials were not getting out to the counties.
my overall impression was that did n't seem as interested in the campaign as the other people who were working at the state headquarters.
goodwyn: murph archibald says that at first, did n't know that mr. bush was serving in the air national guard.
after found out from somebody else, archibald attempted to talk to mr. bush about it.
the president was a lieutenant and archibald had been a lieutenant, too; figured had something to talk about.
in fact, when broached the subject with him, simply changed the subject.
was n't unpleasant about it, but just changed the subject and would n't talk about it.
went out in the evenings and had a good time.
archibald says mr. bush would come into the office and, in a friendly way, offer up stories about the drinking 'd done the night before, kind of as a conversation starter.
're going to talk about their kids, 're going to talk about football, 're going to talk about the weather.
and this was simply his opening gambit; would start talking about that had been out late the night before drinking.
mr. archibald: mean, at that time, was 28; george would have been 25 or 26.
and thought was really unusual that someone in their mid-20s would initiate conversations, particularly in the context of something as serious as a us senatorial campaign, by talking about their drinking the night before.
thought it unusual and, frankly, inappropriate.
goodwyn: according to archibald, mr. bush would also sometimes tell stories about his days at yale in new haven, and how whenever got pulled over for erratic driving, was let go after the officers discovered was the grandson of a connecticut us senator.
mr. archibald: told us whenever was stopped, as soon as the law enforcement found out that was the grandson of prescott bush, would let him go.
and would always laugh about that. "
but that means nothing, since were n't the sort of things guys like bush told the "girls".
was trying to buddy with archibald and impress him.
and search in vain to find just one law abiding citizen
afraid do n't have time today to discuss these, but some stories need attention:
follows a separate probe claiming that thousands of guns meant for iraq 's police and army instead went to al-qaeda .
amnesty chief spokesman mike blakemore said: "'s unbelievable that no one can account for 200,000 assault rifles.
if these weapons have gone missing 's a terrifying prospect."
a coalition forces spokesman confirmed had not received "any weapons from bosnia" and added were "not aware of any purchases for iraq from bosnia".
a nato spokesman said: "there's no tracking mechanism to ensure do n't fall into the wrong hands.
the moldovan airline is aerocom, and yes , 's one of victor bout 's .
's always a bang-your-head-against-the-wall moment, reading again the play the incompetence theory receives, even from some of the administration 's harshest mainstream critics.
but bout 's name is n't likely to be mentioned in whatever coverage this story receives, before sinks like so many others beneath the media 's frothing triviality.
and 's guilty :
an altar cloth was draped over her half-naked body, which was posed as if had been sexually assaulted.
" was about how could humiliate her the most," prosecutor dean mandros said in closing arguments.
have sent this to congress yet?
when the flds under mr. jeffs (and his father before him) grew to some 10,000 followers in several southwestern communities with estimated assets of $110 million; when became clear that government officials, school authorities, and police in those communities had become intertwined with the sect; when ex-members increasingly reported child and sexual abuse charges (mainly involving underage girls forced to marry older men); and when the sect began to use secluded compounds, state and federal authorities started to crack down more vigorously.
in the past, has talked in apocalyptic terms about a violent end to the world, according to former members.
maybe 'm missing something here, but how, exactly, does 'loose' 200,000 ak47's?
'm sure this kind of thing goes on all the time.
now return you to your regularly scheduled programming....
just go here, s simply amazing
count like 14 explosive headlines.
maybe because hint at a larger conspiracy/network of abusers/satanic underground?
read of a case not long ago when some people were trying to get a polygamous judge taken off the bench for not obeying state law.
personally do n't give a damn what adults do to one another as long as there is no abuse invovled.
is the marrying off of young girls to older men often close relatives that enfurates me.
in the warren jeffs cult reassigns wives if the husband displeases him or to reward the new husband.
is genetic and the child needs to get the gene from both parents to turn into a vegetable instead of a thinking child.
the doctor begs them to stop intermarrying but say have to keep the blood pure.
one member actually was convicted of beating his teen daughter unconcious when ran away from 'marriage' to her father 's own brother.
so "lost" some weapon?
's a good thing too.
would n't want those terrorists to run out of shit to shoot at us.
really are milking the incompetence angle though, are n't?
christ, 'd think america would get a bit tired of these guys treating her like was populated with nothing but gullible idiots.
suppose that 's damn lucky for the gop that is populated with gullible idiots.
a country deserves the leaders has, my friends...
('' have three generations of martyrs: grandmothers, mothers, daughters.'')
most of the girls was meeting had grown up in mujahedeen schools in ashraf, where lived separated from their parents.
when iraq invaded kuwait, many of these girls were transported to jordan and then smuggled to various countries -- germany, france, canada, denmark, england, the united states -- where were raised by guardians who were usually mujahedeen supporters.
when were 18 or 19, many of them decided to come back to iraq and fill the ranks of the youngest mujahedeen generation.
though ''decided'' is probably not the right word, since from the day were born, these girls and boys were not taught to think for themselves but to blindly follow their leaders.
has to wonder whether the bright fellows in our government and military who set up the deals with these people do n't know what are, do n't care, or know perfectly well.
that 's all know; 've had nothing to do with it.
"another generation of heavy metal has taken over, and -- sorry -- ai n't just about strippers and dope.
okay, 's partly about strippers and dope.
and 'll get around to that.
but more and more, as metal evolves into a huge international music that belongs to everyone, has gotten to be something weirder.
's become a guardian of morality -- not church morality; real morality.
the moldovan airline is aerocom, and yes, 's one of victor bout's.
know, nature hates a void. :)
agree, hmmmmmm.
and were the columbine killers acting out this "real morality" when indescriminately murdered their classmates.
were death metal brainwashed fans, literally fulfilling the death metal paradigm, er ... morality.
detect the hissing lisp of the lying serpent in this article.
think the jury 's still out on exactly who did the brainwashing when in regard to the columbine killers.
perhaps should look at the death metal phenomenon less as an invitation to violence than as a couter-cultural response to the over hypocrisy of a large percentage of the 'church-morality' crowd, which gives a lot of lip service to loving thy neighbor, but does n't apply that love very far beyond their own congregation.
the last checked, the satanists have a long way to go to catch up with the death and destruction dealt out by self-proclaimed (though false) christians.
'm firing my editor.
well, 's not as simple and clear cut as all that.
're entering into some interesting and perhaps previously unexplored socio-political-spiritual territory here that may require further examination and serious introspection.
would n't wonder too hard.
the answer is likely d: all of the above, due to this being a complex reality live in.
but to me, without question, often know perfectly well.
here is a thought: when the appartently cognitively functional take actions that seem senseless and incompetent, is a most certain sign that have ulterior or hidden motives.
trust you and me to be befuddled by their actions, while "do as wilt".
& here am thinking that really must be getting old.
the police and many of their friends just thought had run off together.
no one can contradict me when say that heavy metal and satanism are closely linked
emerged that chiara, the girl who disappeared with fabio, had a collection of satanic literature and paraphernalia in her bedroom.
"no one can contradict me when say that heavy metal and satanism are closely linked.
're inseparable," says.
yeah, think jeff wrote on one of his posts here in the past several months: "to hell with death".
wholly agree, and would expand that statement to include: "to hell with death metal".
are doing it deliberately.
do really think gwb, and neocons in general are representative of true followers of jesus of nazareth?
( know, ignorant question) then why call them, or any other phonies 'christians', even if themselves claim the appellation.
are merely imposters.
everything claim is a lie, and this above all.
want to be identified as 'christians', and fully suspect that for some of them, the motivation behind their subterfuge is more than mere political advantage, and has a lot more to do with the black magician 's practice of the inversion principle.
need to be more 'rigorous' about how perceive these people.
see them as are, not for what claim to be.
when the apparently cognitively functional take actions that seem senseless and incompetent, is a most certain sign that have ulterior or hidden motives.
trust you and me to be befuddled by their actions, while "do as wilt."
why do n't state it?
my point is that these are all just questions and am undecided as to the answers.
(don't wish to use wikipedia again, 's just easier than spending time looking up more obscure and detailed information.)
blended belief systems such as shamanism, christianity, buddhism, paganism, hermeticism and gnosticism and imbued coil 's vast output with a magickal current designed to have a functionally transcendent effect on listeners.
maybe if formulate your questions a little more specifically will help you in acquiring the answers.
" am, therefore think" :)
went across the bay last night to attend a farmer 's market and music event.
just give your email and/or phone number to these guys and 'll track down your family.
resisted asking any questions that would have required either of them to think.
would have been too painful to watch.
do n't know if this has been verified.
like to imagine the thought processes going on in w 's head if were to actually read the letter, but is hard to picture him actually reading this letter.
as read the letter, considered the vast contrast between mind and morality of whoever wrote it, vs. that of the mind of the man who once said "bring it on!"
have been accumulating for years, and basically give the president to sieze the government whenever feels like it.
ca n't believe there are no serious metal fans who frequent ri.
'm wary of jumping into this fray without backup, that 's for damn sure. :)
'm a regular poster but for some reason blogger wo n't let me in today...but sign me troublefunk.
simply, the questions permeate the entire 'western (mystery) tradition' and perhaps 'eastern' as well, as relate to the confluence of politics and spirituality.
or was supposed to initially be a process of alchemical appropriation?
shall censor the works of poet charles baudelaire as well?
tronicus, if 're still checking this thread:
a bit of a knee-jerk reaction from me there, and apologize for my over-generalizations.
just get hung up on 'christians', as 're the dominant form where come from.
also, 'm quite clear on the fact that those in power now (and, in general, most anyone at the top of a pyrimidal power structure) tend to use the dominant religion as a cloak to hide their true motivations and as a tool to control the masses.
boggles the mind that anyone can take at face value bush 's claims to be a christian, yet many seem to do just that.
seem to remember something about 'by their works shall know them."
do get my hackles up a bit when people haul out the old 'rock-n-roll made do it' argument.
whie do n't subscribe to the notion that the things watch or listen to have no effect on our behavior (which think is patently rediculous), does bother me when people single out a specific group of people to pin the blame on.
again, think the problem is people who sink to far into their own egos, and begin to take their personal metaphors a bit too literaly.
these people are dangerous wether 're head-banging to 'canibal corpse' or humming along to 'onward christian soldiers'.
have nothing but respect for people who adhear to non-violence, forgiveness, and charity, but 's important to remember that christians (or 'smartwolves') do not have a monopoly on that particular lifestyle.
guess those guns will be located enroute to venezuela or found in storage there by one of the us 's local stooges and then have a pretext to ramp the spin up a notch or two.
is the text of a speech given by an arab gentleman before the advisory board of a large multi-nation corporation.
's a long but very worthwhile read.
"as know, usually provide the scientific and technological "entertainment" in our meetings, but, on this occasion, our chairman suggested that present my own personal view on events in the part of the world from which come.
have never been and will never be a government official and have no privileged information.
my perspective is entirely based on what see, on what read and on the fact that my family has lived in this region for almost 200 years.
may regard my views as those of the proverbial taxi driver, which are supposed to question, when visit a country.
could have shared with you some fascinating facts and some personal thoughts about the israeli-arab conflict.
however, will touch upon it only in passing.
prefer to devote most of my remarks to the broader picture of the region and its place in world events.
refer to the entire area between pakistan and morocco, which is predominantly arab, predominantly moslem, but includes many non-arab and also significant non-moslem minorities.
why do put aside israel and its own immediate neighborhood?
because israel and any problems related to it, in spite of what might read or hear in the world media, is not the central issue, and has never been the central issue in the upheaval in the region.
yes, there is a 100 year-old israeli-arab conflict, but is not where the main show is.
the libyan blowing up of the pan-am flight had nothing to do with israel, and could go on and on and on.
have a land area larger than either the us or all of europe.
the social status of women is far below what was in the western world 150 years ago.
is fair to say that this creates an unprecedented breeding ground for cruel dictators, terror networks, fanaticism, incitement, suicide murders and general decline.
is also a fact that almost everybody in the region blames this situation on the united states, on israel, on western civilization, on judaism and christianity, on anyone and anything, except themselves.
a word about the millions of decent, honest, good people who are either devout moslems or are not very religious but grew up in moslem families: are double victims of an outside world, which now develops islamophobia, and of their own environment which breaks their heart by being totally dysfunctional.
the problem is that the vast silent majority of these moslems are not part of the terror and the incitement, but also do not stand up against it.
become accomplices, by omission, and this applies to political leaders, intellectuals, business people and many others.
a few more years may pass before everybody acknowledges that is a world war, but are already well into it.
these are the four main pillars of the current world conflict, or perhaps should already refer to it as "the undeclared world war iii":
suicide murders are not a new invention but have been made popular, if may use this expression, only lately.
even after september 11, seems that most of the western world does not yet understand this weapon.
is a very potent psychological weapon.
creates headlines.
is spectacular.
is frightening.
is always shown on television in great detail.
one such murder, with the help of hysterical media coverage, can destroy the tourism industry of a country for quite a while, as did in bali and in turkey.
may arrange for the best airport security in the world.
but if want to murder by suicide, do not have to board a plane in order to explode yourself and kill many people.
protect the buses and will explode in movie theaters, concert halls, supermarkets, shopping malls, schools and hospitals.
can somewhat reduce your vulnerability by preventive and defensive measures and by strict border controls but not eliminate it and definitely not win the war in a defensive way.
and is a war!
has nothing to do with true fanatic religious beliefs.
would n't expect some of the religious leaders to do it themselves, or to talk their sons into doing it, if this is truly a supreme act of religious fervor?
are n't interested in the benefits of going to heaven?
instead, send outcast women, naive children, retarded people and young incited hotheads.
promise them the delights, mostly sexual, of the next world, and pay their families handsomely after the supreme act is performed and enough innocent people are dead.
never happens there.
the only way to fight this new "popular" weapon is identical to the only way in which fight organized crime or pirates on the high seas: the offensive way.
like in the case of organized crime, is crucial that the forces on the offensive be united and is crucial to reach the top of the crime pyramid.
can not eliminate organized crime by arresting the little drug dealer on the street corner.
must go after the head of the "family".
am very much afraid that most of europe still does not understand it.
unfortunately, seems that europe will understand it only after suicide murders arrive in europe in a big way.
kill people.
is often said that politicians, diplomats and perhaps also lawyers and business people must sometimes lie, as part of their professional life.
but the norms of politics and diplomacy are childish, in comparison with the level of incitement and total absolute deliberate fabrications, which have reached new heights in the region are talking about.
all remember the iraqi minister of information, mr. mouhamad said al-sahaf and his press conferences when the us forces were already inside baghdad.
also does not prevent the western press from giving credence, every day, even now, to similar liars.
after all, if want to be an anti-semite, there are subtle ways of doing it.
do not have to claim that the holocaust never happened, and that the jewish temple in jerusalem never existed.
when these same leaders make other statements, the western media report them as if could be true.
is a daily occurrence that the same people who finance, arm and dispatch suicide murderers, condemn the act in english in front of western tv cameras, talking to a world audience, which even partly believes them.
is a daily routine to hear the same leader making opposite statements in arabic to his people and in english to the rest of the world.
recommend to you, even though most of you do not understand arabic, to watch al jazeera, from time to time.
will not believe your own eyes.
may support or oppose the iraq war, but to refer to fans of saddam, arafat or bin laden as peace activists is a bit too much.
then blows herself up, killing 20 people, including many children, with heads and arms rolling around in the restaurant.
provide an emotional infrastructure for atrocities.
was joseph goebbels who said that if repeat a lie often enough, people will believe it.
is now being outperformed by his successors.
are surrounded by a second wider circle of direct supporters, planners, commanders, preachers, all of whom make a living, usually a very comfortable living, by serving as terror infrastructure.
is this circle that makes sure that women remain inferior, that democracy is unthinkable and that exposure to the outside world is minimal.
is also that circle that leads the way in blaming everybody outside the moslem world, for the miseries of the region.
the outer circle is largely financed by saudi arabia, but also by donations from certain moslem communities in the united states and europe and, to a smaller extent, by donations of european governments to various ngo's and by certain united nations organizations, whose goals may be noble, but are infested and exploited by agents of the outer circle.
the saudis are beginning to understand it, but fight the inner circles, while still financing the infrastructure at the outer circle.
meet their children in the best private schools in europe, not in the training camps of suicide murderers.
never in history, not even in the nazi period, was there such total disregard of all of the above as observe now.
every student of political science debates how prevent an anti-democratic force from winning a democratic election and abolishing democracy.
does free speech protect you when shout "fire" in a crowded theater?
but now have an entire new set.
do raid a mosque, which serves as a terrorist ammunition storage?
do return fire, if are attacked from a hospital?
do storm a church taken over by terrorists who took the priests hostages?
do search every ambulance after a few suicide murderers use ambulances to reach their targets?
do shoot back at someone trying to kill you, standing deliberately behind a group of children?
do raid terrorist headquarters, hidden in a mental hospital?
do shoot an arch-murderer who deliberately moves from one location to another, always surrounded by children?
what do do?
well, do not want to face the dilemma.
leave to you as homework to figure out what spain or france would have done, in such a situation.
is trying to play ice hockey by sending a ballerina ice-skater into the ring or to knock out a heavyweight boxer by a chess player.
international law does not know how to handle someone who sends children to throw stones, stands behind them and shoots with immunity and can not be arrested because is sheltered by a government.
the picture described here is not pretty.
what can do about it?
here need financial starvation of the organizing elite, more power to women, more education, counter-propaganda, boycott whenever feasible and access to western media, internet and the international scene.
above all, need a total absolute unity and determination of the civilized world against all three circles of evil.
when have a malignant tumor, may remove the tumor itself surgically.
may also starve it by preventing new blood from reaching it from other parts of the body, thereby preventing new "supplies" from expanding the tumor.
if want to be sure, is best to do both.
but before fight and win, by force or otherwise, have to realize that are in a war, and this may take europe a few more years.
in order to win, is necessary to first eliminate the terrorist regimes, so that no government in the world will serve as a safe haven for these people.
this is a significant strategic change and applies strong pressure on the terrorist countries.
is not surprising that iran is so active in trying to incite a shiite uprising in iraq.
do not know if the american plan was actually to encircle both iran and syria, but that is the resulting situation.
definitely has ambitions to rule vast areas and to expand in all directions.
has an ideology which claims supremacy over western culture.
is ruthless.
has proven that can execute elaborate terrorist acts without leaving too many traces, using iranian embassies.
is clearly trying to develop nuclear weapons.
iran sponsors syrian terrorism, is certainly behind much of the action in iraq, is fully funding the hezbollah and, through it, the palestinian hamas and islamic jihad; performed acts of terror at least in europe and in south america and probably also in uzbekistan and saudi arabia and truly leads a multi-national terror consortium, which includes, as minor players, syria, lebanon and certain shiite elements in iraq.
in order to win the war is also necessary to dry the financial resources of the terror conglomerate.
when serves their business needs, all of them collaborate beautifully.
is crucial to stop saudi and other financial support of the outer circle, which is the fertile breeding ground of terror.
is important to monitor all donations from the western world to islamic organizations, to monitor the finances of international relief organizations and to react with forceful economic measures to any small sign of financial aid to any of the three circles of terrorism.
is also important to act decisively against the campaign of lies and fabrications and to monitor those western media who collaborate with it out of naivety, financial interests or ignorance.
but really does not matter.
what matters is that the terrorists believe that caused the result and that won by driving spain out of iraq.
if by democracy mean free elections but also free press, free speech, a functioning judicial system, civil liberties, equality to women, free international travel, exposure to international media and ideas, laws against racial incitement and against defamation, and avoidance of lawless behavior regarding hospitals, places of worship and children, then yes, democracy is the solution.
if democracy is just free elections, is likely that the most fanatic regime will be elected, the one whose incitement and fabrications are the most inflammatory.
have seen it already in algeria and, to a certain extent, in turkey.
will happen again, if the ground is not prepared very carefully.
have no doubt that the civilized world will prevail.
but the longer takes us to understand the new landscape of this war, the more costly and painful the victory will be.
a key question is how acquired the anthrax strain first isolated by the texas veterinary medical diagnostic lab in 1980.
had been captured the previous month in rawalpindi, pakistan.
on august 9, 2004, was announced that in the spring of 2001, a man named el-shukrijumah, also known as jafar the pilot, who was part of a "second wave," had been casing new york city helicopters.
's just no longer bureaucratically impolite to openly contest the fbi 's (former) theory about a lone, american scientist.
others argue that was to be part of a second wave of airliners directed to targets on the west coast.
zacarias moussaoui, never the sharpest tool in the shed and thought by his superiors to be unreliable, has told the judge at his trial in a filing that wants "anthrax for jew sympathizer only."
was as part of that surveillance in early 2001 that jafar the pilot studied tourist helicopters in the nyc area.
"what know is that 's always said was a religious obligation to have the same weapons as their enemies," former cia obl unit counter terrorism chief michael scheuer has said.
the wall street journal reported that a computer used by zawahiri contains a june 1999 memo that "said the program should seek cover and talent in educational institutions, which said were 'more beneficial to us and allow easy access to specialists, which will greatly benefit us in the first stage, god willing.' ''
a key question is how acquired the anthrax strain first isolated by the texas veterinary medical diagnostic lab in 1980.
urged the president that brigades and brigades would be coming under the banner of jihad carrying death and seeking paradise.
at one time, some thought had been spotted in iran.
wherever is, authorities need to focus on the traceable connection between him and those or atef recruited.
the same week, the wtc head testified that while had not received any briefing on the use of planes, had taken steps to prepare for an attack using anthrax based on intelligence that had been received.
al qaeda has had anthrax, the raw seed product in its unweaponized form, since at least 1997, when was purchased by bin laden through the moro islamic liberation front ("moro front" or "milf").
another senior al qaeda member (a shura or policy-making council member no less) was working for the egyptian intelligence services and confirmed the report in a sworn lengthy confession.
even zawahiri 's attorney in 1999 said that bin laden and zawahiri were likely to resort to the biological and chemical agents possessed given the extradition pressure senior al qaeda leaders faced.
significantly, the individual who isolated it nearly a quarter century ago (now retired), upon being contacted, does not even report that necessarily sent the only copy of the strain to ft. detrick.
in fall 2004, msnbc, relying on an unnamed fbi spokesperson, reports that the fbi has narrowed the pool of labs known to have had ames that was a match from 16 to 4 but can not rule out that was made overseas.
is far simpler, however, to achieve a trillion spore concentration in the production of a few grams than in industrial processing typical of a state sponsored lab.
the reported finding at dugway undermines the argument of both the "bomb iraq" crowd and the liberals focused on dr. steve hatfill who object to us biodefense research because view it as being useful for offensive purposes.
although the details of the documents on mohammed 's computer may (or may not) point to possible difficulties in aerial dispersal, are fully consistent with the product used in the anthrax mailings.
zacarias moussaoui, who had a crop dusting manual when was arrested, stayed at sufaat 's condominium in 2000 when was trying to arrange for flight lessons in malaysia.
yazid sufaat provided moussaoui with a letter indicating that was a marketing representative for infocus technologies and allegedly provided him $35,000.
as of march 28, 2003, was in a hospital for a cardiac problem and had been granted "pre-arrest bail."
yet all read about at the time was the arrest of the son ahmed abdul qadoos, who receives a stipend from the un for being officially low-iq due to lead poisoning.
was khalid mohammed who told authorities about aafia siddiqui, who has a phd from brandeis in neurology.
the pakistani press reported that was nabbed in karachi after being spotted at the airport in late march or early april 2003.
while 's not easy to separate fact from fiction, attorney general ashcroft and director mueller have publicly confirmed aafia is still being sought.
would know.
the reports say is suspected of having been a member of al qaeda 's "chemical wire group."
is said by one fbi agent to be "very, very, very" dangerous.
allegedly was at one or more meetings in the summer of 2001 in pakistan at which ksm and sufaat were present.
may have been seen in hamilton, canada -- along with egyptian al-maati, who apparently also has received pilot training.
has long been known osama bin laden was interested in using cropdusters to disperse biological agents (since the testimony of millennium bomber ahmed ressam).
is reasonable to credit his statement that got the lesion after bumping into a suitcase was carrying at a camp in afghanistan.
has said that the iraqis made surprising innovations in the milling and drying processes needed to weaponize anthrax.
according to a post made on the internet, aafia siddiqui expressed the same sentiment in connection with us appropriations sought in exchange for the extradition of wtc 1993 plotter ramzi yousef from pakistan.
in late september 2001, was announced that the president was seeking a blanket waiver that would lift all restrictions on aid to military and security units in connection with pursuing the militant islamists.
at the height of the development of his biological weapons program, his brother was extradited pursuant to a death sentence in the "albanian returnees" case (now faces retrial).
's hard to keep up with the stories about billion dollar appropriations, debt forgiveness, and loan guarantees to countries like egypt and israel and now even pakistan.
zawahiri argued instead that have been active since the assassination of anwar sadat in egypt because of the camp david accord and the resulting peace treaty between egypt and israel.
most of the "talking heads" on television, however, knew only that daschle and leahy were liberal democrats and did not know anything of al qaeda beyond what read in the us newspapers.
were sent in connection with the earlier bombing of the world trade center and the imprisonment of the blind sheik, sheik abdel rahman.
the former leader of the egyptian al-gamaa al-islamiya ("islamic group"), was also a spiritual leader of al qaeda.
reportedly treated them like sons.
just because al qaeda likes its truck bombs and the like to be effective does not mean do not see the value in a deadly missive.
was widely published among the militant islamists that martyrs go to paradise "in the hearts of green birds."
in the very interview in which admitted 9/11, and described the codes used for the four targets for the planes, the masterminds admitted to the jenny code, the code for representing the date 9/11, and used the symbolism of the "green birds."
the sender probably is announcing that is of either egyptian islamic jihad, egyptian islamic group or jihad-al qaeda, which is actually the full name of the group after the merger of the egyptian islamic jihad and al qaeda.
at the darunta complex where jihadis trained, recruits would wear green uniforms, except for friday when were washed.
in a hadith the messenger of allah explains that the souls of the martyrs are in the hearts of green birds that fly wherever please in the paradise.
what mosques exactly did visit and who did meet?
are, after all, in this together.
first, the nature of such an investigation is that lack sufficient information to second-guess (or even know) what the fbi is doing.
third, with the "new age" efrem zimbalist, jr. in charge of the investigation, is not likely could do better in striking the appropriate balance between due process and national security.
given the regrettable leaks that was under suspicion, is only fair that the fbi leak with equal enthusiasm the fact that dr. hatfill has now been dropped as a suspect if and when that proves to be the case.
andre is going to look over the list of curves needed for the global assets (august board meeting) one more time before forward it to you.
will make sure that do not request fx and inflation (cpi,ppi, etc.) curves when only one of the curves will actually be used in the valuation process and to determine which inflation index is needed.
typically, receive both fx and inflation from you, but both curves may not always be used.
hope that can give you some time savings by eliminating any nonessential requests.
for now, this is the list of countries for which will probably need the fx and/or inflation curves.
will send the specifics per andre later today.
puerto rico cpi only ( need historical inflation data, as well)
brazil have current data already
china have current data already
am not certain about the needs for the london underwriting/iv group but will request the information from them if have not done so already.
please send us the list of the curves that will need to revalue our international assets for the august board meeting.
have to decline the invitation with regrets.
have too many commitments right now.
just a quick message to follow up on the email that sent you recently inviting you to speak at our forthcoming congress, risk 2001 australia, which is taking place in sydney on 20 & 21 august 2001.
have had an opportunity to consider the invitation yet?
are aiming to have the programme printed next week, so would really need to know as soon as possible if would be available to speak at this year 's congress.
am working from our hong kong office for this week only (tel: +852 2545 2710), and can be contacted by phone there or by email.
will drive on that day?
as mentioned in my voice mail, mike roberts going to hire sara woody, a recent mba grad from rice, into his group.
however, when were talking about this position, mike compared sara to elena.
elena 's title is admin coordinator, and know that sara should not have this title, and honestly do not think that elena should also.
suggest that compare elena and sarah 's duties/ level to other sr. spec. in your group such as kenneth parkhill and sevil to determine if are equivalent, or if their scope of responsibilities and experience is not as broad.
if the latter is the case, could place both sara and elena in a specialist job group ( the salary range is 33-66k).
appreciate all your help.
martin 's box is working wonderfully- 'll have everything transferred to it and give him the keys by friday.
save $21,000 in real money this way, the cash refund sun is giving enron for our other server, using a box that was n't being used by anyone.
'm happy about this.
would have interest in meeting if can present unique investment opportunities that do n't have access to now.
most of my contact with financial advisors in the past has consisted of suggesting a mutual fund, telling me to invest in home depot, sun, and coke, or trying to pass off their banks' biased research reports as something valuable.
if can present opportunities such as access to private equity or hedge funds, or other ideas with strong growth potential and low correlation to the s@p, 'd listen.
'll get the paperwork together and sent to you for naked options.
at some point, 'd like to talk about the diversification strategy in more detail -- perhaps over dinner or a quick meeting after the markets close?
however, with my natural long, 'm not looking to really trade around the position.
believe ene will continue to be range bound, but in case is not, do n't want to forgo 50% of my option premium.
have price targets of where would like to lighten up exposure to ene and will use calls to implement the stategy.
would like that ability in order to hedge some exposure have of unexercised vested options.
was looking at the recent pullback in ene and thinking might be an opportunity to buy back the calls sold.
of course, would then be in a position to sell calls again if the stock makes a bounce.
'm not sure that ene @ 75 is the place, but maybe @ 73.
call me if 're interested.
just rescheduled to wednesday.
are going to the nymex candidate cocktail hour tuesday?
are going to the nymex candidate cocktail hour tuesday?
completely agree.
would like to have a meeting once a week for 1-2 hours with all 6 of us just to make sure are moving forward and to get an update and anything and everything.
my only concern is that take the boys away from their overwhelming task.
what do guys think.
will have to move my weekly meeting to tuesday.
completely agree.

did happen to sign your employment agreement?
if would, please review the entire list and let me know if are in agreement with the presentation by tomorrow evening, if possible.
'm at xif have any questions.
understand all of those comparisons, however, the reality is if lose dean (which will if do n't pay 65k + 10k), will end up hiring a replacement at 75-80k.
know seems like a stretch, but the market for hourly traders is very strong right now.
would like to get this done asap.
am reviewing the request for an employment agreement renewal on mark dean laurent.
business case: if offered dean 55k or 60k would still constitute a over a $10,000 increase (approximately 25%) and taking into consideration was rated as satisfactory at the specialist level.
would still give him room to progress in the current job group should not be promoted.
secondly, will still out price performers that have in the same job group that are excellent and strong performers respectively eg. paul thomas, jason choate, todd decook and peter makkai.

how do feel about taking on another company?
do concur?
if have not already made these decisions, essie 's guidance should be helpful.
can recommend where these companies each fit within the new organization?
if possible, can also give an indication of the rank - 1 through 5?
have a few entities that may need to change groups or be assigned to a group.
think this entity should stay with 83n.
so suggest be assigned to leon.
should be 4 - easy.
think this could go to either holding/administrative companies (same as 17h) or network & services (leon).
should be assigned to north america (glen walloch and kevin walker).
let me know if have any questions.
see that is a 4, so that will be no problem.

was originally inquiring about purchasing a cross or signac impressionist lithograph.
found them and purchased both from a gallery in london, william weston.
should be delivered this week.
are beautiful and will add a lot to our collection.
by the way the lichtenstein is up and hanging in our formal living room and is magnificent.
have also purchased an appel in the last month.
am interested in several artists.
will be looking for one or more of the following.
my concept is that overtime would like to own one of all the following artists and are all depending when find something that really like.
listed all of our (sometimes mine vs. my wife 's favorites and priorities).
are kind of in rank order but as stated if find the piece that like will purchase it.
want signed and numbered.
realize that some were not signed by the artist but is an important fact in my buying decision.
also realize that some may not have done any works on paper or are outrageously expensive.
for example, would like to know if rothko or kline did any work on paper.
at least that is what am thinking now.
do n't know that did any)
by the way, am interested in re-looking at a picasso (although have 2) that your gallery had a couple of years ago.
was for sale in a couple of galleries in sf and was about $20,000.
also am still thinking about the matisse discussed before but as can see, have a lot of other artists am interested in and may remain on the back burner because already have one.
'll find time when things settle down.
see that are scheduled to have lunch today.
may have to postpone again, 'll let you know later this morning.

please leave as a word document and make any changes and additions that think necessary.

neil has a meeting in san antonio (usually is in miami, san francisco, phoenix - not so great this year).
is the officer 's meeting for enterprise, and spouses are invited.
this means wo n't be in town for the compaq thing.
'm watching for some good vacation days, also...
have a couple of questions so can wrap up the loi:
refer to licensed fuel cell energy equipment.
do intend to reference a particular manufacturer, or should this be more generic?
do want to attach a draft of the development agreement, and condition the final deal on agreeing to terms substantially the same as what 's in the draft?
have a concern that the enron optionality bug could bite us on the backside with that one.
do expect to have one epc contract, or several?
'm looking for the confidentiality agreement, which may be in bart 's files (haven't checked closely yet).
if anyone has it handy, could speed things up for me.
see expect to have separate contracts for each project.

'm looking for the confidentiality agreement, which may be in bart 's files (haven't checked closely yet).
if anyone has it handy, could speed things up for me.
are expecting that the portion attributable to each project will be paid as the individual epc contracts are signed?
1. the pricing that have given crra is specific to fuelcell energy and would not be meaningful without listing the manufacturer (i.e., onsi would be a lot more money).
hence, think that have to reference the manufacturer.
in order to mark any 2000 income, will need to get crra to execute the development agreement in 2000.
in my opinion, should show crra a copy of the loi with the assumption that the development agreement is attached.
would actually send them the draft development agreement a couple days after the loi.
based on how crra reacts, would make an ultimate determination if the agreement needs to be attached to the loi.
3. expect at least one epc contract per project.
do n't want to condition the acceptance of one project on the performance of another project.
what are going to get her?
hear are coming our way soon.
your mama is so fat: when hauls ass has to make two trips.
when dances makes the band skip.
when was diagnosed with the flesh eating disease the doctor gave her 13 years to live.

when goes to the zoo the elephants throw her peanuts.
has to iron her pants on the driveway.
yo mama `s so fat, all the restaurants in town have signs that say: "maximum occupancy: 240 patrons or yo mama" yo mama `s so fat, when ran away, had to use all four sides of the milk carton.
yo mama `s so fat, instead of levis 501 jeans, wears levi`s 1002`s.
yo mama `s so fat, when gets in an elevator, has to go down.
yo mama `s so fat, was born with a silver shovel in her mouth.
yo mama `s so fat, `s got smaller fat women orbiting around her.
yo mama `s so fat, could sell shade.
will have to wait and see :-)

off and on ( with jackie gentle 's help ) have pulled together a one page communication note on our fundamental operating standards ( itself a one page summary ).
are in the final stages of this process - where draft a cover letter for john which will introduce this for inclusion within globalflash ( the enron europe newsletter )
have any thoughts on draft or cover note ?
meagan does have a couple of big things on the weekend in january -- national charity league senior presentation (big dance that and i are committed to help with), the bearkadette ball and a winter party for cotillion.
believe that these are three weekends in a row, january 6, 13 and 20th.
so the last weekend in january would work well (and will need a rest from formal affairs!).
and do want to do it on a saturday or sunday?
saturday probably works better for me, just so that am back in houston and doing laundry by sunday afternoon!!
said a shower would be grand.
has some big presentation mid-january.
should set a date now?
am turning into mother?
think that is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental operating standards, but wonder about the most appropriate timing, enough of a global message and the means of delivery.
on the means of delivery, am not sure from your note whether or not fully understand the intent.
with regard to a global message, think that one of the key points around fundamental operating standards are that are intended to be global in nature, applied to every commodity and every location where engage in trading activities.
with these operating standards implemented worldwide, will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and will be able to ensure enron top management that there is consistency in operating standards worldwide.
am not sure from the article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across.
the last knew after and brent drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this was being circulated (shona took this to do after brent 's return to houston) for comments to all business controllers.
do n't believe that are quite at the point that can say that all business controllers worldwide have reviewed, understand and have implemented these standards.
my commitment to rick causey is that will have that global report in production by the end of the year.
shona has commissioned mike moscoso to work on this, and believe that mike has already been working with james new.
so question whether or not want to publish info about fundamental standards that can not yet report against.
would a more appropriate time be after the global operations controller meeting in october when should have worldwide buy-in and commitment to these standards and (hopefully) our first draft of a meaningful exception report?
since asked for input, hope that do n't mind that gave you some.
have been able to keep ena 's direct group expenses flat year on year, are trying hard to keep the corporate allocation flat year to year as well.
do have a view on how might be able to achieve this goal?

apologize if offended anyone.
please let them know that was simply quoting the ceo of a large, regulated utility in california.

remain convinced that if can just get the facts in front of people will modulate their approach.
given the short notice, will politely decline to participate at the hearing on monday, but will let the good senator know that, in general, intend to engage actively in the process and plan to help california find a solution that works for everybody.
can get some help on the ibm issues?
at this point, our it contacts are backpedalling a bit and suggesting can overcome the tibco and terminal server problems.
weblogic is required by backweb, although is designed by a separate company.
messages will not be delivered simultaneously to all users in the same domain, nor will be delivered for two to five hours after are sent by the message administrator.
another thing to consider is that these messages will be set to expire and disappear within a set period of time, meaning users can not retrieve them and read them later (as can with e-mail).
this means that could be away from the office for several days and miss a message entirely, because would have expired and disappeared by the time returned.
the plain fact is that a few members of it are pushing this initiative, but lack commercial sponsorship.
are hoping corp will foot the bill for a pilot which will allow them to fully test this tool before implementing it company-wide.
please let us know if have additional questions.
do have a sense for how many can reach, how many ca n't and where are?
are whole offices (eg tokyo) unreachable or is only those who have home offices?
erin rice and i would like to meet with you to discuss the issues concerning backweb before proceed.
as can see from the design document, are pretty significant.
if have any questions, please call 503/464-7927.

shall be available on both days.
will be nice to see you again.
p.s. by the way, did have a chance to take a look at the eol?
what do think?
if possible, think the cleanest way to run this biz would be to put a box around the prime broker biz.
would still operate under the master isda but could set up a mutually agreeable credit support annex for this biz.
would still keep the 20,000,000 line referenced in schedule b of the poa agreement.
let me know if think this is reasonable and workable.
too, are open to suggestion as the global and enron relationships are very important and a high priority to us.
am going to find out how much line currently have available... probably already have this.
should allocate a piece to global which would solve the problem of other cargill people using the line, putting us over the limit, without knowing...
could change the language of the poa to this...
will not go over global 's piece of the cargill line...
think this would solve our main concern...
please let me know... are eager to keep trading with global and yourselves...
let me know if need to discuss anything.
am hopeful that are ready to prepare execution copies.
look forward to your response.
do n't know anything about these transactions.

need the prices below.
can help out?
need your help again.
need prices for may, june, and july.
can please review this additional language to the risk management policy ( or circulate to jeff hodge)?
know that address audit rights in the llc agreement so this may not matter anyway if this is a right already have.
let me know what think.
'm still at home.
'll be in tomorrow.
have a fax machine at home, though, if prefer.
otherwise, can see who can scare up at the office, or can have laura sign and 'll initial later.
which do prefer?
are in the office to initial signature pages today?
know that jeff is in portland.
if jeff is happy, 'm happy.
spoke with jeff hodge yesterday regarding the additional language from peoples regarding audit rights.
however, did suggest a couple slight revisions to protect enron 's interests.
therefore, need to know asap if there are any problems with the draft as written.
otherwise, will be sending it to peoples as our final revision by mid morning.

let me know what think.
is less complicated for to initial and fax than to track down someone who does n't know anything about it and get them to initial it.
can print it here, initial it, and fax it to whomever want.
plus, work with janet a lot so may get some comfort from that, instead of having a lawyer has n't dealt with initial it.
is very conscientious about what signs, and who initials what.
where and to whom do want it faxed?
since will be janet signing, will probably be better to have the initials on the pages first.
let me know which is easier and can coordinate.
'm still at home.

'm working on it now.
maybe (enron) could review it tomorrow morning, then send it to fce.
can meet around 10:00.
that way, can get it to them in time for weekend review.
was good to hear from you!
had a nice thanksgiving here too.
's funny, because usually 's just me, mom, craig and danelia, and danelia does n't really like roasted turkey or roast beef (not that would say it to me!), so there is not just the same joy in cooking would be elsewise.
was good having the girls down.
's not for the meek.
was incredible what a good player alena was.
had her cards memorized as well as everyone else s (when play 'll see why can know everyone else s hands!).
expect craig did n't want mom to see his place because was messy.
think compared to my house, 's embarrased about his apartment.
then, also, 's got so much stuff in there right now, that do n't know how 's going to fit baby stuff.
would only give him a 6 month lease when renewed his lease last month because do n't want 3 people in that small apartment.
so 's going to have to start looking for another place.
and his apartment is so run down down 'm afraid roaches might be crawling over the baby.
guess mom is going to come back down sometime in march or april to see the new baby.
'll have to come visit to check out my new house.
's got its own bathroom and tv, and is pretty cozy.
as far as the call with uncle ben goes, if was thrilled to hear from me could n't tell by his voice.
was a pretty stilted conversation for both of us.
but, guess, 's a start...
've already made my xmas plans.
leave the evening of the 21st, my flight comes in about 10 pm, and leave the morning of the 27th at 6 am.
's good chatting with you.
do n't understand, what do mean by "log in an email"?
anyway, got you message, and got the world series thing (although had already received
chris and ben did a marvelous job for thanksgiving, can testify that was one of the best thanksgiv8ing dinners 've ever had ( not gonna tell them that, do n't want them getting swell heads).
ma said had a great time in houston, was happy to see yourself, as well as c & d.
think likes her special room in your house.
r gonna be the first to see the new baby (woudn't be wierd if the baby gets botn on jan 5th?)
are coming for xmas?
hey, mr. computer, ca n't log an email in to your sister?!
can take my assistant taffy milligan off these emails again.
if so, 'll get it signed by craig breslau today, then bring it to you for countersignature.
'm not sure have the authority to sign documents w/o special authority...
no, does not mean that.
our concern is that do n't want any trading related defaults to ever trigger a default under a loan transaction which has a swap as a component.
if do add all the entities, does that mean that would not need to put in place a separate agreement for eccl?
with respect to deutsche bank (""db"), have one credit issue remaining, db would like us to add all the enron trading entities db trades with as specified entities under the isda master agreement and are somewhat hesitant to do so, as this could potentially roll up swaps under structured loan transactions into a default under the isda agreement.
with respect to first union national bank, the draft were working from was so old that agreed to look at our current form of agreement which was sent to them on 11/8/00 for review.
can please give me an update on where are in the negotiations of the isda with the following counterparties and confirm which enron entity are negotiating on behalf of.
spoke to mark taylor about your signing authority, and agrees that do not have the authority to execute documents on your own, but as long as are only co-signing documents signed by an authorized officer as a control measure 're ok.
the referenced tagg # was entered as a 'new counterparty', can please let me know what counterparty this is so can correctly assess the counterparty exposure.
sorry have n't written you guys in a while to keep you properly updated.
am indeed checking on flights to seoul and do n't think 'm going to go at exactly the same time as my parents.
as much fun as are, figured would probably do some different things than what have planned for them.
as for ted, things are still going well although have n't see him at all this week ( are two very busy people).
in one sense 's great, but also makes things a lot harder to read.
anyway, 'm sure my mom told you guys but travis and kathy got to meet him and think went well.
hopefully, if 're still dating come december, and chuck can meet him when come back to visit.
'm planning on dragging him to at least one of the u.t. games, just have to find out when wants to go (as well as properly prepare him for the scott/kelley/parks/wild card gang and the full-day affair that is a u.t. game).
went with emily and her mom last night to see the musical "rent" and was wonderful.
also, 'm going out to san diego for the labor day weekend to visit hoot 's daughter julie.
how are doing?
a little birdie told me that were checking into tickets for seoul.
are really?
would come with your parents or separately?
in any case, have had some more time to do some exploring (and shopping), so have some good ideas about what to do if come.
think that will stay in korea when your parents come and do the whole base thing (which will take only a few minutes, actually), but are considering going to china or somewhere during part of thanksgiving.
'll do whatever want want if still are coming!
do yahoo!?
the play was very good and think well received.
'd forgotten how blown away was by some of the songs the first time saw it in ny.
the cast members really have to have incredibly powerful voices to pull off a few of the most poignant numbers ( think this could be your true calling).
anyway, 'm sure 'd mentioned it before but yes is a very smart girl.
as a result of that, has managed on several occasions over the years to detract from my enjoyment of playing trivial pursuit or watching jeopardy by absolutely obliterating me (the girl actually did her senior thesis on trivia).
kori told me saw you last night at steak night and introduced herself since failed to do so the last time went.
should let you know though that was very offended this morning that did n't spell her name right in the email - mean 's such a common spelling.
so was darren there last night to meet her or do just think 'd make a good match?
's a very fun girl.
-- due to the lack of response yesterday, 'm beginning to worry about your success with the road test...
'm going to assume that did n't get around to it.
ran into corey last night at lw s and am thinking this is a girl for darren.
'll talk to you later.
maybe should ignore the sentiment of the quote sent earlier...
think may be adhering to it too faithfully.
at this rate may have to start pinning notes to your shirt to remind you to do things.
however, having driven with you on several occasions feel confident will be able to pass the test with flying colors.
keep in mind though that if end up failing will not let you forget it (and, as have established, have the memory of an elephant).
'll keep discussion of me to a minimum and just say that things are well on 32.
thought 'd like to know that the dixie chicks are coming back to houston dec. 12 and will performing just down the street from you at the compaq center...'s all about you and your needs.
just found out that need to take the tx driver s exam both written and on the rode.
this is a two day process and all because let my ca license expire.
know need some of your organizational skills.
as discussed, the following is revised disclosure regarding direct access to deal with the cost issue:
please call if want to discuss.
if are not the intended recipient, please delete the e-mail and notify us immediately.
the least can do is pass this news along.
is there anyone else should tell?
fyi... sound like bobby is in serious condition.
think 'll send us another update once 's out of emergency and into a room.?
then 's real easy to call ben taub to find out a room number.? the address is below.?
does n't sound like can receive visitors yet.
do know the address to send cards??
do know if bobby can see visitors??
thought might like to know.
bobby is a member of a bicycle team, while cycling this weekend, and other members of his team were injured by a truck.?
is currently in the emergency room at ben taub hospital.?
can not accept calls, visits or flowers at this time, since is in the emergency room.?
think 's a good idea since the provisional application is on file - travis is the internal lawyer who has taken care of the patent application so will have better ideas for where the words should be placed and appropriate look and feel ( would guess near the copyright notice and roughly equivalent size).
are thinking of adding a patent pending message to key enrononline pages (like the homepage).
can offer comments/concerns/guidelines?
does make sense for to set up a meeting with participating from buenos aires?
'm not sure have much to tell them at this stage - actually, 'm sure do n't have anything new to report but if do that would be fine with me.
intend to see as many people as possible regarding eol implementation.
will meet dave forster and his team among others.
would like to fit a meeting with you as a group or individually.
please let me know about your availability and if is possible to meet with more than one of you in one place.
wish to launch on sept. 1 - meaning will need to be sending mailings sometime around mid-august.
if need more, there is a proposal from the documentation committee for a new alternative for calculating termination amounts ( heard about it in amsterdam) that think will be particularly attractive to the energy markets.
do n't know where this stands officially ( have n't heard any developments since amsterdam) but can find out from bob pickle if want.
should include isda energy definitions, cftc matters re energy and an overview of power deregulation developments in north america.
might also add a few items about international developments and the eei physical power trading form.
am thinking 4 slides at the most.
is that what want?
days away: sept. 21 through oct. 3 (assuming work on the day leave and go back to work the day after return)
believe the message forwarded to me belongs to the mark taylor at ei (based in london).
unfortunately, ca n't forward your message to him directly (there seems to be a problem with the attachment).
if still have it, can send it to him at "mark ei.london taylor"?
will take care of it.
please send the draft to troy black and will forward to the cp.
looked at the uecomm master and had some comments--such as our name is wrong, the cross default threshold for us should be us $ and not aud, and there were a few other questions had.
could please send an executable version of the contract to fred, david, john and me tomorrow?
if 're ok with it, 'd like to execute it as soon as possible unless there are any objections.
have inserted the company details of uecomm as requested.
have also amended the timeframes in the credit support annex to 10 days instead of 2 days.
if these amendmnets are agreeable to you can please print and arrange for execution.
if have any questions please do not hesitate to give me a call.
please let me know if have any questions or need anything else.
've been asking everyday if anyone had heard if the "babies elliott" had arrived.
glad to hear that are all healthy and were a good size, and that mom is doing well.
know all are going to have so much fun with them.
hope 've been storing up sleep, cause looks like wo n't be getting much for a while.
these three little ones do n't realize how lucky are to have such a nice dad, but 'm sure 'll find out soon.
although small, are all "fully functioning" and very well - are in the lowest level of special care (and will probably be in there for another two to four weeks) until can feed properly and maintain their weights.
attached are the fax cover pages for each of the nylon and polykron deemed isdas just sent you.
am attaching a clean and blacklined version of the proposed resolutions authorizing the opening of brokerage accounts.
have attempted to revise them to make them clearer.
perhaps jim armogida can assist in revising them as am sure is more familiar with the way enron corp. likes their resolutions drafted than are.
let me know if have any questions or need anything else.
am following up regarding the status of our comments to the form of guaranty for pemex that provided to lucy ortiz.
look forward to hearing your comments.
received this draft from niagara mohawk marketing, inc. for our review.
will pass along to the appropriate person?
am told that our respective credit departments want to raise the credit lines to $10m for each party, but to effect that will have to modify the existing guaranties accordingly.
after have had the chance to review the attached, please send me a marked-up draft and can discuss our concerns from there.
should have any questions, feel free to call me.
can be reached at 315-460-3344.
look forward to hearing from you.

thanks, know are busy.
am putting the credit worksheet on the fax machine to you as soon as send this message.
let me know if have any questions or need anything else.
just got of the phone with hai and told me how to make an adjustment on a day to day basis in regards to incorrect liquidations but also explained this is just to make the daily p&l #'s right, if nothing were done the month end p&l would still somehow work out because adjustments would be made.
does this mean that for june and for a certain portion of july should not do anything and just make adjustments on a going forward basis (and assume everything will work out at month end)?
if this is the case would like someone to walk me through june to see if the numbers did really work themselves out as there was a large swing in second order on june 29 that was not adjusted for.
let me know if one of you could help do this.
'm now looking closely at the option liquidation problems.
believe that there might be a sign-flipping problem for puts that 's causing this whole issue.
'll keep you posted.
'll get back to you as soon as i have more info (hopefully later today)
the post id am looking at for calgary is 11608.
am looking at the option liquidation report and all of the $65 puts are in the money and the $75 call is also in the money.
do n't want to wait till month end, let 's adjust the numbers now and for the june 29 2nd order, let s take that value into june since relates to july puts.

yes, would like to participate.
have asked for 4 outside ports and should anyone else need to join in, may do so with the access code and without operator assistance.

attached is a rough draft of my talking points for a panel 'll be on at a cem conference in sf on thursday afternoon.
have distributed to western ga team (plus steffes) for comment and thought may have some, too.
as discussed yesterday, laird and i spoke and think that the presentation is good to go for thursday.
'll need to update the numbers for the offer made to s.d. last week.
had mentioned that might want to include a shaped product.
still considering it?
let us know and can add it, and make any other changes 'd like to make at this end.
sandi sez 's actually happening at 10 am and 's renewable-focused.
as know, the suffix online is purely descriptive and now used by many companies.
therefore, any trade mark registration that incorporates the word online as a suffix in the way that use it will not enable its owner to prevent others from using the word online.
given the above, if have adequate protection for the word enron (which covers the services that offer on-line as well as your core activities), 'd say that another application for the words enron online is probably unnecessary.
however, if use a particular logo for the on-line service, that should be registered.
hope the above is clear.
if could respond to me on this request, thanks
'm @ x37047.
assume this is akin to why mcdonald 's trademarks "mc"everything?
can please give me a call to discuss trademarking?
i.e. are covered if proceed a word with "enron"?
if are covered, then was necessary to register enrononline?
if have received it by mistake please let us know by reply and then delete it from your system; should not copy the message or disclose its contents to anyone.
per my conversation with edmund this morning, are moving the following countries to the non-approved list: austria, belgium, croatia, czech republic, denmark, poland, portugal, romania, singapore, and slovenia.
for banks incorporated in a non-approved jurisdiction, may be possible for to trade out of a branch located in an approved jurisdiction (i.e. u.s. and u.k. branches).
yes, should add compliance with otc derivatives and/or commodity contracts and qualified party requirements of the securities act (alberta), securities act (british columbia) and securities act (ontario).
with regard to our annual review of this list of laws need to comply with, do not want to add the canadian provinces new "eligible swap participant" equivalant rules?
are the best!
why does always have to be my deals...?!!!
've received a personal invitation to a nymex crawfish boil on april 3 at 5:00 at garden in the heights at 3926 feagan.
would be nice if shankman and john arnold could attend.
perhaps can give them a personal invitation...
have received the amendment to the bc gas isda master executed by bc gas, which adds the canadian securities representation, so do n't have to add the rep into every confirm.
am going to count it as signed, since bc gas has signed, but still need it to be signed by ecc.
can get it signed asap and back to me.
did n't either until clicked on the down button and popped up.
when have a minute, 'll give me a call and 'll come around and show you how to unfreeze the panel.
spoke to edmund to get the scoop on what are going to be doing on the confirms for credit derivatives, and said that his current understanding is that all of the confirms will be done out of london.
communicated that to bob bowen.
also said that london was going to be hiring 120 people to deal with the credit derivatives business.
carol, will handle this or mark?
'm a gas trader on the west desk and one of my customers had some issues with our electronic trading agreement.

please contact me if require any additional information
despite the best efforts of it, continuing problems with the as400 application, a better understanding of the inconsistency between stock reconciliation reports, and concerns over the useability of the outright stock screen enquiry are such that am currently not confident of delivering sufficient accurate information to aa to satisfy their audit requirements - which at a macro level is the transparent audit trail between stock and forward positions to full accounting values.
consequently need to inform you of, and/or require your approval for, the following :
will discuss with aa the following
will continue to investigate potential misstatements in the system p&l, as a result of data or system valuation problems, within the month end reporting timeframe.
will be in touch directly re the items needing approval

if have any questions please call me on x34703
would like to thank you for personally taking the time to closely review my application.
understand how competitive the process has become, but felt that with my work experiences, recommendations, personality, extracurricular activities, etc. that this would compensate for my disability.
after talking with professors titman, ronn, brown and jemison, was sure that the school was the right place to get the education was looking for.
am still certain that the school is the best place for getting a great graduate-level education, so want you to know that am going to do whatever takes to get in next year.
plan on taking two or three graduate level finance courses at the university of houston this summer and fall to demonstrate to the admissions committee that can compete at the graduate level.
also plan on retaking the gmat test.
due to my disability, this will be a monumental task; but am determined to prove to the committee that can be successful at the texas graduate school of business.

sorry about that, was working on the teco o&m costs.
please send me an excel spreadsheet which depicts the value that see associated with the heat rate spread option.
want to make sure that understand exactly how propose valuing the transaction and how this value would be booked.
will be valuing/booking a series of monthly call options or a series of daily call options?
what power curve are valuing the deal against - pjm east or west hub?
please send me the current fuel curve that are converting to $/mwh to value the deal?
what volatilities are using to value the options - monthly volatilities or intra-day volatilities or a blend of the two (if blending please show me what formula using to blend the two vols)?
what expiration date are using, i.e.: for monthly call options the 15th of the relevant month, and for daily options?
what correlation are assuming, 15% flat for twenty years?
are deducting all operating expenses from the value of the option?
are using the "sprdopt" exotic options function to value the option?
are using the $/mwh vom dollar amount as your strike?
article 6 of the gallup compression services agreement (which am sending to you separately) with ecs obligates ecs to "work in good faith with cdec" to establish an automated system that would automatically have alerted us to peak loading conditions on cdec 's system.
had a pretty good idea when signed the contract that ecs would not be able to complete that by the contract start date, so negotiated a fall back plan under which ecs is obligated to "assist [transwestern] in developing a manual system to accomplish the same result and will hold harmless and keep [transwestern] whole for all cost and expenses" associated with the manual system.
will fight with them about who owes the $200k that james mentions below based on their failure to "assist" us in managing the cost.
in the mean time, need to make sure that are doing everything can to get a handle on the situation to mitigate future costs.
do have someone who is watching this out there?
are running so full tilt on tw that may not have as much flexibiltiy to manage this situation as expected, but let me know what can do.
james had heard that one hold up was the absence of a confidentiality agreement-- guess between ecs and transwestern--that would permit ecs to communicate to us the details on how to access teh key info. from cdec.
that sounds like a bs excuse from ecs, but it that 's what are saying, let me know and can figure out a solution.
would please contact gerald nemec and review the gallup compression service contract in respect to the load control management.
my understanding was that ecs was to provide a means to access cdec 's online profile in order for to make a decision to avoid running the compressor during cdec 's peak load periods.
have not received access to this information which has resulted so far in additional electric cost of $200,987.33 for the period of july through september.
additional cost will be incurred for the remainder of this year, that have not been able to review yet.
this cost is averaging $79,000 per month if continue to run the compressor as have in august and september.
good point, but 'm comfortable 're covered because our bidders were all bidding on a chunk of capacity and primary points.
our letter agreement simply memorializes that will charge the same negotiated rate whether the gas flows on primaries or alternates.
assume from your message are ok with this and can get it nailed down?
just got done looking at the underlying contract language as set forth in the pro forma service agreement in the tariff and specifically says that the max rate would apply unless a discount or negotiated rate has been agreed to.
my concern with adding the language below is, could be argued that not everyone knew the rate would or could apply at any point, since just stated topack and needles and if knew might have bid a different rate??
after discussions with the commercial group propose that that redlined language be added to the attached dynegy agreement and to the 4 other negotiated rate agreements 've done.
if there are any objections need to get back to me asap.
in discussion with dave, thought would be good to put this together in a format of questions and answers.
however, as will see, the questions thought of got kinda long- but think need answers for all of them.
one thought is to have just the agenda as a couple topics and then lead in with the first two questions as 've listed.
here is.
incorporates mr. stojic 's and mr. kelly 's initial comments.
please review it and let me know if have any comments on or before tuesday afternoon ( will be out of the office monday).
lou, do have any sort of policy on requests like this?
this particular chair is designed to help with back problems, which has.
many people at enron already have this type of chair, but rarely, if ever, have a surplus because are so popular.

forwarded the sommer letter to stan and discussed it with him.
as stands, mkm and i will probably bring it up with sommer in ok city and strongly suggest the importance of coordinated communication to the producers.
stan may also bring the letter up orally next time 's on the phonne with gibson or kyle as an example of how not to handle this situation.
yea-- was outstanding news!

have been working closely together to identify the issues as develop and propose solutions.

(even though has bigger things to do in d.c., this is his legacy and recognizes that if deregulation does not work in texas, the repercussions could be global.)

are right, do need a formal plan, thane has started an initial draft.
if ercot goes the way of california - either due to market power or poor market design rules - will be a bad day for deregulation and for pat wood.
jean and thane, think that need a formal plan on what to do over the next 3 - 6 months to leverage this situation.
would like to discuss this with you on friday am.
am free at 8am on friday before rick 's budget meeting.
may want to discuss with becky.
as an outgrowth of the meeting leslie and i had with scott and hunter a couple of weeks ago, have begun work to develop an electronic tool that would allow us to provide ongoing summaries of ferc gas activities, and possibly electric activities, in a format that can be linked to the fundamentals intranet site used by the traders.
envision a format that would provide a brief summary and analysis of the order, filing, etc. with a link to the source document as well for those who would like more detailed information.
this would replace the paper copies and your people are currently getting.
in the meantime, could please provide a contact on your side with whom could discuss technical issues?
what do need to do?

with divisions, eol does request a new password application for the applicant reflecting the name as noted below.
when the company is set up in the eol database link the company to the parent and reference the cp id.
let me know if this is the appropriate steps that would like to see.
was my understanding with the eol team that all divisions would have the legal incorporated entity as part of the name.
are the right lawyer to look at this?
informed tana that made the change in global counterparty to include, "a division of cargill incorporated".
will meet in the near future to discuss the issues surrounding division and trade name setups in global counterparty.
if sam 's description below of the gcp procedure is correct, looks to me like something needs to be changed.
since divisions of companies are not legal entities do not have the power to contract in their own names.
my suggestion is that global counterparty use the same name that the customer has signed on the enrononline password application -- my understanding is that the enrononline team returns inappropriate applications to the customer until are correctly completed.
would appreciate if could get this one fixed today and, if have any problem with changing the gcp procedure, please let me know.
(although, have broken that rule for legal in the past.)

through tv and newspapers , hear constantly about identity fraud using stolen social security information.

do not feel secure at all to see my ss in so many databases at enron, especially when some databases are from third-parties (out-sourcing).

our execution team needs to get some guidance and planning for this picketing should interfere with the progress of the work.
in that respect, need to dial in rick johnson and olgletree to plan and communicate that plan to the execution team.
think the first step is a call between yourself, me, mark stubley and mike indivero.
have heard that the pipefitters have established a picket line at the payne creek site today.

's a good starting point.
am currently working on guidelines for argentina which will address both physical and financial trading.
am checking on london.
'm not exactly certain as to what are looking for.
obviously the foreign offices have issues that may not apply in the us (although la. is about as close as can get to a third world country).
let me know how can help further.
here is -- printed this 2-sided and laminated it.
looks like the 2-day l/c issue is an issue.
'll call you shortly.
faxed it to you and will have the original fedexed overnight.
hope 'll have time to review it today.
do not have anything from us in writing confirming the agreed changes.
joe asked that fax the revised gtee wording that has been agreed ( believe was our agreeing to reduce the claim period from 15 days down to 5) and the new l/c wording (drops the 2 day period to replace an l/c with a different bank if the first refuses to pay).
know talked about these issues earlier, but tiger 's lawyers want to get everything agreed in writing now so final docs can be issued for signing, even if are the one's issuing the gtee and l/c.
call if have questions or if can be of any help.
there is an outside chance could have everything set to go this week.

have gone international?
this weekend 'm off to sao paulo and buenos aires on business.

'll make the change.
instead of suggesting a specific rate increase - 10 or 15 %, think should acknowledge that a "modest" increase may be necessary and may in fact be desirable - but that the specific amount of increase should be reasoned and subject to well thought out evidence and hearings, not just determined by whim.
in general, should not be overly prescriptive at this point and know agree with that.
otherwise, think have captured the points excellently.
're in the process of developing a strategy to take us through the next few months.
the price spikes pose real political risks for davis and and his folks need and want an easy way out.
on my panel, loretta lynch asked reliant and duke to supply her with the details of the contracts cut to sell their power forward to marketers.
wolak said somewhat emphatically that the nature of california 's market structure makes impossible to single out a single participant as the culprit.
also stated that just everyone 's just acting in their own self-interest, responding to the screwed incentives embedded in the structure.
implication-- seems prudent for enron to understand better its risks of getting fingered.
're right, sue.
currently, need three interviewers for thursday, march 1st and one interviewer for friday, march 2nd.
as always, thank you for your time and please contact me @ ext 58369 if have any questions.
'll not say anything.
have gotten a price?
just like what happened in enron 's initial vpp program are find more interest in oil drilling projects rather than natural gas projects.
are currently working on a bid (due 1/31) for the medusa project which involves murphy (operator), agip and callon in mississippi canyon blocks #538 and #582.
the initial reservoir reports estimate reserves of 80-120 million barrels of sour crude and estimate initial production to be 40,000 bpd starting in 1q 2003.
tom 's group would like to know if have any interesting in buying the crude on either a fixed or floating basis.
is far too early to expect murphy to enter into a physical or financial contract, but tom hopes to get us first and/or last look from murphy when the time is right.
please address, and 'll check with legal as well.
typically only book deals when everything is signed off.
following up on our discussion yesterday; for these types of deals, do nt think s necessary to have all the documentation of our counterparty 's authorization to enter into the agreement.
the primary reason need these things is for the scenario where a muni does a derivative deal with an open-ended downside, loses $50 million, and then claims that was not a valid contract.
in our case, are only hedging.
are collecting a premium up front and their total cost is known up front.
therefore will not attempt to make this claim.
even if did, our risk is limited to the premium , not some big payout.
is possible to combine the standard isda and our confirm into a single long form?
by going away from the standard isda maybe can eliminate these requirements because the payout liability is only 1-way.
highlight the relevant skills in the summary.
was posted on dec. 11, but the human resource dept said that if is still on the internet, is open.
'm not sure how would have handled it.
could n't say no...so nicki (the little girl-10 yrs. old) and i waited for the bus.
was now, 8:15 and there was no sign of her bus.
on top of things, had quiz at 8am.
decided that nicki would just have to wait on her own.
asked her if had any relatives that would want to know of her whereabouts.
a bus that runs through uofh arrived and almost got on without her, but could n't do it.
finally, told the little girl that would have to accompany me to school (8:30am).
stayed for the remainder of the lecture.
after class went back to bus stop and within minutes her bus arrived.
told the bus driver where to drop her off.
notified her grandmother with the time of the departure.
spoke to her prior to my note.
the analyst and associate programs recognize have many analyst needs that need to be addressed immediately.
while anticipate many new analysts joining enron this summer (late may) and fulltime (august) felt necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an off-cycle recruiting event.
are planning this event for thursday, february 15 and are inviting approximately 30 candidates to be interviewed.
am asking that forward this note to any potential interviewers (managers or above).
will conduct first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the afternoon.
need for interviewers to commit either to the morning (9am-12pm) or afternoon (2pm-5pm) complete session.
in addition, will need the groups that have current needs to commit to taking one or more of these analysts should be extended an offer.
can provide me with more details?
4. in section 6.2.1 'll just note that the discount rate sentence think is still an open issue.
7. delete the definition of costs as is already defined in section 6.2.1.
will also add granting/perfection language.
11. in events of default, clause (a) refers to a dispute section which 'm not sure exists.
12. remedies should be deleted as is already covered in section 6.1.
would add setoff language.
have attempted to incorporate the changes that jim has incorporated in our long form power agreement which ena has suggested to date into the short form.
please note the following as review:
1. the short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing billing services -- all of our midmarket forms anticipate that will act as customer 's billing agent and that will collect all amounts due related to t&d and the like from the customer (and reflect same on our invoice) and pass those amounts on to the customer 's utility.
2. did not include a "setoff" provision in this draft, mainly because the vast majority of the time, will not, nor will an affiliate, have another agreement in place with these customers.
if feel strongly about our including a setoff provision, will do so.
3. the change in law provision reads a bit differently from the long form -- the thinking here is that the long form language is very lengthy and rather harsh (and 've had great difficulty selling it in the past).
taking into consideration this class of customer, decided to include certain items, including our inability to cover our costs due to a change in law, rules or practices as a "force majeure event" in an effort to soften the approach (see the gtcs).
also do not address calculation of a termination payment in the event of a change in law as the long form does -- again, more in the interest of "saving space" than anything else...
let us know your thoughts on this document and if are comfortable with our using this until such time as the hybrid form is launched.
if are comfortable, will drive these changes into our other midmarket power forms.
p.s. please be sure to copy sarah dietrich and jennifer hillegonds on your response -- will be taking this project during my "hiatus" -- am moving to pa on friday of this week, and will be out of pocket through approximately 7/16.
will start up again in mid-july...
have faxed to you the form of bond, our proposed bond provisions and the eei master.
am waiting on the confirms and will send them to you shortly by fax or e-mail.
our letter of credit person would be more comfortable if deleted all of the language that makes the lc transferable.
are okay with that?
if so, are ready to execute?
understand that are still reviewing the attachment that lists the open transactions.
how are making out on the revised version of the loc?
in addition to my other comments on the mid market power form, think should add a forward contract rep.
are playing tomorrow at 9:30?
as mentioned in my e-mail, john lepore at select energy (settlements group) is trying to reconcile our list with his list.
needs more info about these trades (i.e., price info) and would like to talk with you about it.
once agree on the list, can sign the eei master.
need to include all outstanding transactions.
do want 6/1/01 and forward or do want to include all of may since have not been settled?
just let me know and can send you a new attachment.
does attachment a to the select eei master need to be updated or is the version that sent to me the current version?
think valerie mooney (our credit person) and ed sacks are still discussing some minor fine tuning of the loc format.
spoke to bob bruce this morning - 're all set on the language in the schedule to the isda, and there is a minor credit/billing issue in paragraph 13 related to the timing of transfer of interest on collateral that val will discuss with ed as well.
as far as the eei goes, the only remaining issue that 'm aware of (aside from finalizing the loc) is whether 've finished coordinating the attachment containing the list of prior transactions.
sounds like may actually get these documents executed early next week.

simply refers to the same icc publication for the transfer process that governs the letter of credit generally.
is there some specific concern that can address?
with respect to the guaranty, will delete the schedule.
is a fairly standard, fully reimbursable interconnect with questar.
will notice that questar has requested a "payment plan" that details when will pay transwestern for the interconnect due to the recent enron events.
also, will notice this interconnect may not be subject to the ciac tax gross up, but to protect ourselves, have added language in para 3.2 that protects us financially if the irs ever comes back to determine that this interconnect is subject to the ciac tax.
hope to execute this agreement this week.
if have any comments, please let me know.
after execution, will forward a final copy to you for your files.
are looking at putting the metering facilities on their row (also, think will have to purchase about 50ft of row from elpaso to get to questar 's property).
as look at this, if for some reason can not obtain elpaso row, will have to look at plan b which would be to put the metering on our row.
if think that may 1 may be difficult due to receiving the parts/materials on a timely basis because of the issues that vendors may have with us because of recent enron events, please let me know.
questar has already informed us that would help obtain parts/materials to our specifications if helps achieve an in-service date of may 1.

john, sorry for the late response, but think can implement immediately.

the telephony group has the new tw hotline number and extensions ready for use, have the solution center entering the greetings and terry kowalke has a new form and procedure for the customer service reps. to use for updates.
how much notification would like to give the tw customers before implementing the new tw hotline phone number?
can do a popup notification along with changing the number on the web page, can also put out a critical message which will send an email to customers.
do think need to do more?
was aware.
just could n't remember if was you or terry.
was under the impression that terry kowalke had notified you of the implementation, tk was also made aware.

let 's talk before leave town next wednesday.
here is the job description and the operational accountabilities for the position mentioned to you last sunday.
as can see will take someone with some very good skills in organizing and interpersonal relationships.
will also require someone who is fairly mature in their own spiritual journey.
if know someone who might fit the bill ask them to contact me and/or send me their resume.
since the bankruptcy filing, vendors have been very reluctant to ship material prior to being prepaid (daniels, fisher, rosemont, other).
have worked with daniels on a chromatograph on another project and prepayment has taken 45 days alone.

are looking at putting the metering facilities on their row (also, think will have to purchase about 50ft of row from elpaso to get to questar 's property).
as look at this, if for some reason can not obtain elpaso row, will have to look at plan b which would be to put the metering on our row.
if think that may 1 may be difficult due to receiving the parts/materials on a timely basis because of the issues that vendors may have with us because of recent enron events, please let me know.

a state senate committee is set today to start serving 16 subpoenas on electricity producers and officials who manage california 's energy grid to determine whether acted in concert to manipulate energy prices.
the investigative committee, headed by state sen. joe dunn, d-santa ana, is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that has earned a name around the capitol: "the palace coup."
the central question behind the palace coup is whether terry winter, the president of the independent system operator, acted alone when took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge.
" do n't know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort," said dunn.
"the governor believes was the defining moment, when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis," maviglio said.
" was an emergency," fishman said.
" had to take action.''
" (electricity generators) grinned and beared the $750 price cap, but this new plan by iso was too much," said dunn, whose committee has been investigating since march.
said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to "fix" prices, which would violate federal trade laws.
in the oct. 31 letters, electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps were n't removed would lead to a collapse of the energy market.
power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap, saying could n't make a profit even under these constraints.
began to withhold power from california, and on dec. 7 the iso declared its first stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts, which were narrowly averted.
did n't mention anything about it.
"in retrospect, should have told them,'' robinson said.
" was beyond belief that failed to mention something so significant.
prices, said, did not spike as a result.
" believe the action took addressed a severe concern,'' robinson said.
"in our view, did not believe changed or made worse the financial situation.
felt made it better because introduced a process for review and refund."
" did what thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing."
" filed an emergency motion, and were not about to let california go dark,'' hoecker said.
" (iso management) did what any independent system operator would do."
believes memos and e-mails around the time of winter 's dec. 8 actions should provide vital clues.
" do n't know why did what did, but are eager to find out," dunn said.
"terry said made that filing in the interest of californians, but find that argument has no basis in fact.''
should resurrect mike smith 's note and get him on the call in the attempt to avoid recreating the wheel on this one.

the industry of marriage and kids, heard me.
marriage is, in and of itself, a noble concept, but too often leads to kids and kids flat out suck.
how can say such an abomination, ask?
look around you and notice all the mind numbing trailor trash cretins out there who should not be procreating, yet do.
these are the kids who will destroy society, because of the crapfest the american family has become under the post hippie culture, heard again.
and might think by reading this blame the kids.....
not so, kids are what kids are and will do what do.
is literally monkey see and monkey do with them.
's the bad parents out there who fuck up their lives and do nt seem to understand that once decide to have kids, is indeed time to grow up and be a responsible role model for those kids.
when blame it all on society, there 's noone to to take responsibility and all of a sudden have generation of fucked up kids who are likley smoking, drinking, doing drugs, fucking the neighbor or some internet perv just because are too lazy to see waht 're doing.
people like this will never have my sympathy, nor do deserve my sympathy.
probably is.
made a choice to be a mommy, do nt get a break until move out, that s the choice that madea and that 's life.

looks like nasa is ready to sour again after it's devastating loss from the columbia accident which occurred nearly two years ago.
hope so.
seeing another "columbia" incident can be quite frightening ( woke up to it early in the morning when was in texas).
do n't need another incident as exploring the cosmos is something that keeps our imagination going as a species.
maybe one day will allow space tourism, (hopefully that will be in the near future)although would recommend that nasa build new shuttles instead of trying to preserve the older ones.
instead are encouraging everyone to come forward if see any potential problems (as is clear that overlooked problems could result in unnecessary losses).
but let s hope for their sake (and the sake of all space lovers out there) that can redefine their image and rekindle the hope of space colonization again.
see the merit in flowing with duality.
have written a lot recently about healing the self so today here are a few words on healing our collective body, mind and soul.
think of all life, if will, as one great choir or one grand congregation.
any major dischord and all suffer.
living out of synch with nature is the great disease, from that flows all the tributaries have come to think of as sickness.
are only as strong as our weakest, are only as healthy as the sickest amongst us- playing sports and being in the army taught me that lesson before was finished being a teenager.
when the healthy treat the sick with scorn and intolerance brings us all down.
when those lucky enough not to have herpes create a climate of shame and indignity for those of us who do, not only are hurting us, but are hurting themselves.
there is no escape from the collective ocean all swim in.
what project will always come back to either reward or haunt you.
are now suffering from the consequences of our rape of the environment, our rejection of the natural for the industrial, and our embrace of violence over peace.
jesus said that what do the least of the people do to him.
what are doing to the least of the people?
if are all in this thing together, let 's play nice.
remember that what do to yourself affects me and everybody else, remember that what do to me and anyone else shapes your destiny.
no matter what progress make as individuals in becoming healthier, will never achieve real health until collectively decide to create a healthier reality.
will choose to live in harmony with this planet or crash and burn in a conflagration of arrogance and disregard?
will choose to rise about prejudice and intolerance or go down kicking and screaming with holding on to fear and anger?
what are searching for?

"all of the research and all of the preparation did leading up to the trip gave no indication that there were bears in the soper [river] valley where were canoeing," dr. fortier said.
dr. fortier, an orthodontist, learned there was at least one polar bear in the central region of baffin island in july 2001 when felt what thought was a dog leaning on his tent wall.
"my first thought was to push it away," said.
"a few seconds later my girlfriend saw the shadow of a bear 's paw through the tent fly and then started ripping through the ceiling."
the bear dwarfed the 6-foot-1 mr. parenteau, knocking him to the ground, said.
dr. fortier threw a large rock at the bear, distracting it and allowing parenteau to escape but then turned on 25-year-old patricia doyon, who was in the same tent.
"the bear gave chase and gave chase," said.
was beside the bear 's head and stabbed it with an upper cut below the jaw in the neck a couple of times."
mr. crawford threw several punches at the assailant before was stabbed in the heart.

if have any questions, please request clarification prior to rating the answer.
can get details about nasa spending here, from their own webpage.
guess if are someone not familiar with how nasa benefits our society can see how one might form the opinion of yheggy-ga.
let me put it this way - if have watched tv recently, crossed a modern bridge, flown in an airplane, recieved any form of modern medicine, did any mathematics, drove a car, used a cellular phone, etc. then have somehow directly reaped the rewards which nasa has returned to us.
believe that nasa is a huge waste of tax payers' money, but there are so many huge wastes of tax payer monies, that find best not to think about it.
also think the national endowment for the arts is a waste, but guess would rather see my money go to the nea than nasa.
in response to steve 's comment: do really believe that spending trillions on space exploration over the years was the only way to invent the cellfone?

china 's insatiable demand for energy is prompting fears of financial and diplomatic collisions around the globe as seeks reliable supplies of oil from as far away as brazil and sudan.
has invested $3 billion in the african country 's oil industry, which supplies it with seven per cent of its needs.
then, this month, said that opposed moves to refer iran 's nuclear stand-off with the international atomic energy agency to the united nations security council.
this year overtook japan as the world 's second largest consumer of energy, behind the us.
since president hu ordered state-owned oil firms to "go abroad" to ensure supply, have begun drilling for gas in the east china sea, just west of the line that japan regards as its border.
"nobody thinks that there will be a lot of oil and gas in this part of the world," said.
" may be a difficult political issue but do n't think the energy content is worthwhile."
eurasia group, a new york-based firm of political analysts, said its oil experts worked out that china was paying such an inflated price for its investment in brazil that the cost for the oil ended up with was three times the market price.
"beijing may end up in a early 1990s japan situation, where is forced to sell recently purchased overseas assets for a fraction of what paid for them."
"sudan is the primary example," said.
" marks the first time in recent years that china has promised to wield its veto power in the un security council against a petition initiated by the united states and backed by france and great britain."
if consider that still need the assistance of other visualizations to help the mind feel the spirit of transcendence, try the following before moving onto the more formal method below.
is always good to stick to a formal intense meditation practice like the one for beginners described in the mp3 file that follows after the visualisations.
with each breath, feel the muscles in your body becoming lighter and lighter, and also your external motor and sensory organs are feeling like are withdrawing from the world into a special inner quietness.
imagine the tension melting away as continue breathing rhythmically and naturally.
as sit above the world, the warmth of the golden sun penetrates your body and makes feel warmer and warmer.
surrounds you.
now are far above the earth - into space.
want to merge your mind with the greater universal mind that surrounds you.
are in a state of peace and relaxation.
want to bring something back with you from your deep space experience where sensed your mind merging with the universal mind.
now feel yourself returning to where sit ... move your hands and feet a little, stretch them.
another thing can try.
imagine 're sitting on top of a mountain, and that 's the most peaceful place can think of.
feel that 're sitting there in complete peace, right on top of the world.
feel 're completely surrounded by that infinite peace and happiness.
think internally, intuitively, not by words, of the meaning, as 're repeating it.
is important to take the idea, not just the intellectual analysis.
touching deep into the idea is what builds intuition - is a synthetic process.
feel 're surrounded by infinite peace and happiness, and feel that your own sense of existence is in direct contact with that endless peace and happiness all around you.
can go further and feel that your unit consciousness, a dot in the infinite consciousness, is merging with infinity.
continue for as long as like, then open your eyes.
do n't worry if have trouble concentrating on the mantra and ideation - that 's normal.
takes some time and practice to be able to focus on the one thought.
if do n't practice, then nothing happens.
well maybe a miracle could happen, but let s face it 're ordinary people and so require practical day to day techniques!
from what hear from the news media, one could easily conclude that all christians are opposed to gay marriage.
presents the case for marriage equality and states, “ are resolved that the state should not interfere with same-gender couples who choose to marry and share fully and equally in the rights, responsibilities, and commitments of civil marriage.”
please note that the declaration addresses only civil marriage; says nothing about religious beliefs or practices regarding marriage.
if have any questions please feel free to call me (after sat. the 26th, when will return from a trip).
sign-up lists will be available at the services on feb. 27 and march 6, or can email me.
will email names and email addresses (or postal addresses) of signers to ncrc4me in time for their “lobby day” in raleigh on march 15.
become most fully human when love another person.
can grow in our capacity to be human - to be loving - in a family unit.
throughout history, tyrants have known that by denying the right of oppressed peoples to form and nurture families, can kill the spirit of those peoples.
as religious people, clergy and lay leaders, are mandated by faith to stand for justice in our common civic life.
oppose the use of sacred texts and religious traditions to deny legal equity to same-gender couples.
insist that no one, especially the state, is allowed to coerce people into marriage or bar two consenting adults, whether of the same or differing genders, from forming the family unit that lets them be more fully loving, thus more fully human.
respect the fact that debate and discussion continue in many of our religious communities as to the scriptural, theological and liturgical issues involved.
however, draw on our many faith traditions to arrive at a common conviction.
are resolved that the state should not interfere with same-gender couples who choose to marry and share fully and equally in the rights, responsibilities, and commitments of civil marriage.
affirm freedom of conscience in this matter.
recognize that the state may not require religious groups to officiate at, or bless, same-gender marriages.
as faith leaders, commit ourselves to public action, visibility, education, and mutual support in the service of the right and freedom to marry.
would tear down our system of checks and balances, giving far too much power to the president

demonstrates an excellent "judicial temperament," being courteous, mild-mannered, respectful of all people; careful in his work, meticulous in detail.
yes, is true that some people do n't like the way think will vote on the supreme court.
but other people do like the way think will vote, and the ones who favor him seem to outnumber the ones who oppose him.
so now the senate is getting ready to vote soon, on whether to approve him or not; and at this moment (evening of jan. 27, 2006) looks like has more than the fifty-one votes needed for approval.
the president is very eager to go ahead quickly and get this vote, because very much wants to have samuel alito on the supreme court, to be judging the cases bush is interested in.
sometimes can make a bad decision very quickly, then regret it for many years to come.
that is what is about to happen with judge samuel alito, in my opinion, because has one tragic flaw - a very serious blind spot in his thinking - which makes him completely unacceptable for the position of supreme court justice: does not really agree with the system of "checks and balances" built into the constitution, and is ready to start tearing it down in order to follow the "unitary executive theory," which calls for vastly-increased presidential power at the expense of congress and the supreme court.
" would tear down our system of checks and balances, giving far too much power to the president."
in our constitutional system, have three branches of the federal government: the legislative, executive, and judicial branches.
and the basic idea behind the checks and balances have is that if one branch of the government goes crazy, the other two can hold it down.
the military is not part of the executive branch: is a separate entity.

but remain uncertain about whether china aims to beat the united states to the moon in its secretive space effort.
" are not in any hurry.
want a program that will be a success," johnson-freese said.
" are not going to rush it, because do n't want it to be a budget buster.
" applaud china 's space achievements," nasa spokesman allard beutel said tuesday.
" wish them a successful return of their astronauts."
stressed, however, that nasa would not follow this week 's chinese mission through formal channels.
the first phase, said, will demonstrate the capability of a multi-compartment spacecraft that will leave a test module in orbit when the two fliers return to earth.
"there is always the possibility could jam us up, make us look like are not numero uno," pike said.
as turned out, the soviets never made it to the moon.
" would get in line in front of the russians.
and would not have to land on the moon to take us down a notch."
the two developments, said, could eventually enable china 's space program to mature to the point that experts could assemble and launch from earth 's orbit a spacecraft capable of circling the moon with astronauts and returning home.
'm a member of a local animal rights news, and get regular emails from other members and the staff.
recently, read an email that reported the horrific nightmare civet cats go through by sick losers who put them in sheds and heat the inside of the sheds up to 110 degrees with fires, so that can periodically scrape the sweat off of their genitals and sell it to corrupt corporations who use it to prolong the scent of perfumes.
the animals eventually die, which is because these demons are so greedy, want as much of their "product" as can get, instead of letting the cats go after a point, as an act of humanity, mercy, love.
below pasted the email text, and has a link to a website that automatically plays this song the author of the email created.
has cat 's "meowing" for the vocals, and might really find yourself in those furnaces, feeling and thinking those terrible feelings and thoughts that these cats do before die.
the main reason wrote this post is to ask anyone reading this if know of some way can help put a stop to this cat holocaust.
am serious about doing something.
if love cats so much, why are n't doing something???
do n't want to appear before god on judgment day and have to explain why did n't do anything like this in my life.
read the civet cat story from a little while ago, and tonight, when my mom emailed me about it, re-read it, and went to the website with the song the author of the email created.
well, sure enough, when heard the cats "meowing," imagined the hellish moments these poor beautiful creatures of god were living, what went on in their tiny, sweet little minds, and decided that want to do something about this torture.
so, if anyone can give me some advice, 'd sure appreciate it!
think for starters, and those of you who believe in god could say a special prayer for them.
will.
've pasted the email for those who have n't seen or would like to re-read it.
's also got the website where the song has been uploaded.
was thinking, that while 'm sitting here, relaxing and enjoying myself, those poor innocent animals are being cooked to death with heat in those holocaust-esque death chambers.
and what am doing about it?
this is my first time posting to the list, so feel somewhat embarrassed by "promoting" a song wrote, but think is fitting because is directly tied to extreme animal suffering as a result of human lack of empathy, but an abundance of human greed.
'm not sure if any of you know much about civet cats, but to brief those who might not know, will quote james rachels, author of world hunger and moral obligation among many other animal rights-related books and articles.
( kind of see him to be for animal rights theory as peter singer is to the theory of utilitarianism applied to non-human animals).
if anyone wants the complete article, email me, as is a very good article which no meat-eater can read and not sense their own hypocrisy.
but this is what says about civet cats:
are confined in this way until finally die.
musk, which is scraped from their genitals once a day for as long as can surv ive, makes the scent of perfume last a bit longer after each application.
if anyone is interested in listening to this song, and in offering their opinion, whether be positive or negative, 'd appreciate it.
but also hope no one feels any obligation to download, especially if have an internet connection as slow mine (28k).
although there are no human vocals/lyrics, think it's subject matter is audible.
's also on the net.
was already a vegetarian when read it a little more than a year ago, but was one of the bigger factors for me in going completely vegan.
hope all are well.
"note to wigner: do think your friend could feed my cat?
found this on a bulletin board and decided to try it: do n't care about the useless pre-fabricated crap this message usually says.
all say is, works.
within seven days, started getting money in the mail!!
figured would end soon, but the money just kept coming in.
in my first week, made about $25.00.
by the end of the second week had made a total of more than $1000.00!!
in the third week had more than $10,000.00 and 's still growing!!
this is now my fourth week and have made a total of $42,000.00 and 's still coming rapidly.
's certainly worth $6.00 and six stamps, and have spent more than that on the lottery without ever winning!!!
let me tell you how this works and most important, why works..........
also make sure print this out now, so can get the information off of it, as will need it.
promise you that if follow the directions exactly that will start making more money than thought possible by doing something so easy!!
's easy.
's legal.
this is not a rip-off, is decent; 's legal; and is virtually no risk - really works!!
if all the following instructions are adhered to, will receive extraordinary dividends.
will now become apart of the mail order business.
are in the business of developing mailing lists.
now should have six sealed envelopes, each with a piece of paper stating the above phrase, your name and address, and a $1.00 bill.
what are doing is creating a service.
are requesting a legitimate service and are paying for it!!
so checked it out with the u.s. post office (1-800-238-5355) and confirmed that is indeed legal!!
step two:now take the #1 name off the list that see above, move the other names up (six becomes 5, 5 becomes 4, and etc.) and add your name as number 6 on the list.
change anything need to but try to keep this article as close to original as possible.
( think there are close to 24,000 groups)
all need is 200, but remember, the more post, the more money make!!
if have any doubts, refer to title 18 sec. 1302 & 1341 of the postal lottery laws.
keep a copy of these steps for yourself and whenever need money, can use it again, and again.
if were of integrity, the program will continue and the money that so many others have received will come your way.
note: may want to retain every name and address sent to you, either on a computer or hard copy and keep the notes people send you.
this verifies that are truly providing a service.
(also, might be a good idea to wrap the $1 bill in dark paper to reduce the risk of mail theft).
your name will move up the list geometrically so that when your name reaches the #1 position will be receiving thousands of dollars in cash!!!
send it now, add your own name to the list and 're in business!!!
step one: do not need to re-type this entire letter to do your own posting.
this will paste a copy of the letter into the notepad so that will add your name to the list.
if want to do your posting in different settings, 'll always have this file to go back to.
fill in the subject, this will be the header that everyone sees as scroll through the list of postings in a particular group, click the post message button.
're done.
all have to do, and really works!!!
ever since ate up red riding hood 's grandma and blew down the houses of two-thirds of the three little pigs, the big bad wolf has held a persistently bad reputation.
rumor also had some renegade biologist brought a caged pair to yellowstone and released them into the wild sometime in the 1970s, hoping to reestablish a breeding population.
osu forestry professors william ripple and robert beschta have found that wolves actually promote stream-bank stabilization, although have given the phenomenon the unfortunate name of "the ecology of fear" -- something that smacks of the horrible pr resulting from the wolf 's relationships with riding hood and the three pigs.
explained that elk in yellowstone used to browse unmolested on young aspen and willow growing near the banks of streams, a behavior that prevented the saplings from reaching mature stages and increased the possibility of soil erosion.
"all have to do is look at the photographs," ed bangs, wolf recovery coordinator for the u.s. fish and wildlife service, told upi 's blue planet,
" say, 'wow!'
" may be uninteresting to a lot of people," beschta told blue planet.
"there's a lot of impact on plants and say, 'who cares?'
but 've been looking at streamside communities.
's important with regard to the quality of streams.
've only been there for 10 years.
in 10 more years 'll have a better idea."
vacated the fws decision to downgrade the wolf 's status.
even occasionally attack people, which wolves do not -- despite the propaganda from the brothers grimm.
remains to be seen whether will extend the same courtesy to the arriving gray wolf.
seem to be just that: rumors.
bangs said these animals are not equipped to survive in the wild, however, and all almost certainly have died.
said after 10 years of dna testing on northern rockies wolves, scientists have not found a single strain that did not belong to one of the wolves the agency released -- or their descendants.
scientists can argue all want about how many degrees celsius -- or fahrenheit -- the planet is warming and what the trend portends, but meanwhile earth 's plants, insects and animals are not waiting for the outcome.
already are altering their patterns of behavior in response to what is happening.
turns out one of the surest barometers of the warming climate is the response of the non-human natural world to changing conditions, and biologists who study the responses have been aware for some years the biosphere is acknowledging global warming.
the eastern phoebe is showing up about 20 days before used to.
an analysis of 65 bird species in the united kingdom shows about one-third are laying their eggs four to seven days earlier than did 25 years ago.
"across the united states, the northern edge of species' range is expanding," said.
"empirical research pointed to climate as being a strong driver," said.
throughout the united states, said, "spring is about two weeks earlier.
the alaskan tundra, for instance, has switched from being a net sink of carbon dioxide -- absorbing and storing more carbon from the atmosphere than releases -- to "being a net source of co2 (releasing more carbon than is stored) because warmer winters have allowed dead plant matter previously stored in the soil to decompose and release co2."
"should the arctic ocean become ice-free in summer, is likely that polar bears and some seal species would be driven toward extinction," the report concluded.
the ipn report examines commercial fish species, but neglects important non-commercial animals, such as seals and polar bears.
assumed a value -- unspecified -- for non-commercial species, and in doing so rendered the warming news a bit less rosy.
"when dandelions have set the mark of may on wisconsin pastures, is time to listen for the final proof of spring," wrote aldo leopold in "a sand county almanac."
"sit down on a tussock, cock your ears at the sky, dial out the bedlam of meadowlarks and redwings, and soon may hear it: the flight of the upland plover, just now back from the argentine."
in the world press, commentators predict that katrina will make a profound change in the way the us is perceived at home and abroad, especially following the scenes of poverty and racial divisions believe the disaster has revealed.
meanwhile, president george w bush has said will lead an inquiry into how the disaster was handled.

what see in new orleans is a perfect example of the downfalls of the welfare system, a form of socialism that many in this country know is the true problem.
have seen the pictures.
people think is race, but is not.
is the welfare society that was new orleans."
at least is n't using this disaster for cheap political point-scoring."
" do not feel has changed the us citizens which is what was needed, even now the majority want "gas" despite the fact are polluting the world more than any other country in the world and refuse to stop, perhaps this natural disaster, which let 's face it looks like a product of global warming, will change their views, why not pick things up with your hands and walk with your legs, other people in the world do it, "gas" is not the be all and end all!"
distances are not what are in the old world.
here, cars are absolutely necessary, and 'd have to have one, too.
"the us will work its way through the loss of a city and are making progress after seven short days.

do n't believe that folks who believe that america is the land of opportunity will change their views from this recent news.
have a friend who came here from bulgaria after winning a green card in a lottery.
(believe it or not, takes a minimum of 5 years to apply.)
know, 've lived in the dallas/fort worth metroplex most of my life.
when not in texas, lived in la and san francisco.
did n't expect to react that way, but when was looking around my workplace in nashua, new hampshire, and everyone else looked pretty much like me, was really very eerie.
additionally, reviewing the standings of louisiana and mississippi in the educational stakes, 'll find usually land near the bottom of a list of 50 states.
yes, 's a valid reflection of america - do have cities like this.
do n't know if this will change other nation 's perceptions of america.
suspect will not change greatly... but never know how much stock people put in the news.
do know that this will change the face of america.
expect that many of the displaced people (those affluent and those not) will remain in the places were evacuated to.
sure, some will return, but have a feeling that once many begin to get jobs and temporary housing, may be shy about returning.
'm interested in what america will look like in 5 years.
these are some of the things 've been wondering...
okay, 'm new to this forum and really do n't like bush, so my view point is slanted and admit that.
rarely listen to the news or to what politicians or lawyers say because so many tell lies that none have credibility so what 's the point?
what know is that have a close friend who's aunt disappeared in new orleans.
my friend did n't have computer capability, so spent the day searching and posting online.
is oct. 6, and not one family member has been located.
what saw was dozens of school buses submerged that could have been used to evacuate people who had no transportation.
what heard was the mayor of new orleans, saying that did n't order the buses or anything else to be used because was waiting on someone else to tell him what to do.
when common sense takes a back seat to politics and legal mumbo jumbo what have become?
about 30 seconds into his address, started flogging the terrorist issue just one more time.
ironically almost burst out laughing and was all could do to keep his mirth down to a barely controlled smirk.
even ca n't believe that is trotting out this old saw again.
guess if have a schtick that is a resounding success once, ca n't help but trot it out every time your act is going sour.
the gall of it all is that bush is stumping for more money to build more refineries, when what should do is pour money into making the us independent of opec or crude oil all together.
have the technology; if are going to spend billions of dollars touting "freedom" why not spend those billions making all of us free?
'm sorry makes want to puke so shut him off.

<<in "love's labour 's lost" find a character don adriana de armatho, full of affection and bombast.
true, but two in england that know of were a part of the essex entourage: dr. lopez, who had been physician to essex' step-father, the earl of leicester, had apparently treated the young essex for some socially unacceptable ailment, and antonio perez, who was a guest at essex house in the early 1590's.
to be sure, both lopez & perez were conversos--but were thought of in england as being, as undoubtedly were, at least ethnically, jews.>>

came from liverpool, that was the port base to the titanic, destroyed by god because of the arrogant insult of captain smith (also from liverpool): "not even god can sink my ship" (not only the captain, but also the rest of the crew and even the orchestra playing at the titanic were from liverpool).
came from the nation whose king enrique viii adulterated the bible so that divorce could be allowed and in this way be able to give loose rein to the many divorces from his wives and subsequent murdering of the same ones and to whom god provided a wife with six fingers as abomination (anne boleyn)...once again 6, number of the beast....
is interesting to observe that this nation is nicknamed "the devil 's island".
will vanish and shrink.
are more popular than jesus and pope"....
came the disintegration of the beatles' minds with lsd which has caused, among others, schizophrenic lyrics such as " am the walrus" and incoherent schizophrenic musical expositions like "revolution number 9".
is interesting to notice that was shot seven times, being seven, as well as three, the holy numbers in holy cabalah tradition....
to paul mccartney whose company 's logo was a person toying with the planets as if was a god, and who was being very much deluded in his ego trip by the fact that was made "sir" (when in england even the road sweeper is made sir, as long as produces money for the nation), god provided cancer to the wife.
at the same time mccartney was going out with heather mills, used linda 's death for promotional ends, due to his waning popularity.
paul admitted that made linda suffer a lot, but did n't say that was because felt insecure as a man due to his womanish face and effeminate manners and also because with his age his sexual power was not the same, even though has never been much.
the early days were the days of competition between paul and his wife and john and his wife and knew had to compete with ugly john for the leadership of the band in front of their wives and having yoko ono made him aware of his lack of virility and repressed homosexuality, grew the beard that see in the "let it be" film and started to show pictures of naked women in the same film, doing every effort could to be seen as a man....
is easy to note the uneasiness of mccartney when sings: "'ve got a feeling, a feeling ca n't hide..." in front of yoko in the film.
( already had the traumas that his previous girlfriend jane asher had caused him when made him aware of his little manliness and effeminate manners).
paul has such a big inferiority complex as a man, due to his effeminate face, body and personality and due to his repressed homosexuality, that found himself a handicapped woman with only one leg, so that could stand out, being very conscious that a full woman would make him feel the superiority of virile men again, as jane and linda did.
is very conscious that money and fame can not buy virility and manliness.
besides being a murderer, john lennon had sexual intercourse with homosexual brian epstein to get him interested in going to see the band at the cavern, trauma from which never recovered.
in the beatles' song "get back" advise black joe to "get back to where once belonged", as if england was not a place for black people.
sometimes back, paul told george in the apple offices that the new generations are a bundle of idiots and useless people, but in any way would have also been slaves of the beatles.
the jewish marriage living to the right of george 's house said that is an arrogant person who does never return a greeting.
the receptionist of "hand made", the former film making company of george harrison said: " do n't have any relation with that man anymore and do n't want to know anything about him".
george harrison said that is tired of listening to people talk about john lennon....
george harrison said in a video that "oasis is a very untalented band and should n't be playing at all", all of it being the truth, but the beatles is also a band of very poor musicians, if musicians at all, who could only play a couple of elementary guitar chords and who are as untalented as oasis.
paul mccartney said recently that believes in using magic, and does lots of charity, thinking that in this way will compensate for the curse of god that is upon him and that took his wife 's life because of his satanism and involvement in black magic.
thinks will deceive people in this way, so that the real mccartney will not be perceived.
after the devil began his devastating job from the ghostly "devil's island" through his nine main puppets (beatles-rolling stones), possessed an endless amount of other schizophrenic bad musician in the afore mentioned island and weakening their conscience with drugs, made them proclaimers of homosexuality, aversion to religion, destruction of family values, dissipation, mental illness, antisocialism, etc., etc.,
if wonder why there is misery and curse in your house, is because own some l.p, cd or another article related to the cursed by god beatles and rolling stones.
recommend you to take that curse out of your house throwing away everything related to the devil 's main nine puppets....

if the us attacks iran, is probable that american forces - already taxed by attacks from sunni factions - will also face reprisal attacks in iraq from shi'ite factions loyal to iran.
the result will be a dramatic escalation in us and civilian casualties, us forces will be required to bunker themselves further into their bases, and us forces will find themselves required to fight the very government just finished helping into power.
while iran 's conventional army is not what was during the heyday of the iran-iraq war - their armaments have deteriorated and the veterans of that last war have retired - the nation enjoys substantial military strength nonetheless.
include 120,000 iranian revolutionary guards trained for land and naval asymmetrical warfare.
there is considerable evidence that is developing both a long-range missile force and a range of weapons of mass destruction.
has never properly declared its holdings of chemical weapons, and the status of its biological weapons programs is unknown."
even the small navy that iran puts to sea is capable enough to harass shipping, and several cases of small boat operations against oil well heads in the gulf during that period made clear small asymmetrical tactics of the iranian navy could be quite effective."
is iran 's missile armaments that pose the greatest concern for american forces in the gulf, especially for the us navy.
recall that was two exocets that ripped the uss stark to shreds in 1987, killing 37 sailors.
china is seeking the construction of a pipeline from iran to the caspian sea, where would link with another planned pipeline running from kazakhstan to china.
china and japan, and the world at large, have more dollar reserves than require.
would have no problem teaching a hegemonic superpower a lesson if the need arose."
when china 's currency ceases to be undervalued, american shoppers in wal-mart, where 70 percent of the goods on the shelves are made in china, will think are in neiman marcus.
should decide to squeeze, will all feel it.
is difficult to imagine a justification for any action that could envelop the united states in a military and economic conflict with iraq, iran, syria and china simultaneously.
did it once already in iraq.

50= approximate number of policy changes and regulation rollbacks injurious to the environment that have been announced by the bush administration on fridays after 5pm, a time that makes all but impossible for news organisations to relay the information to the widest possible audience.
2000 - year that cheney said his policy as ceo of halliburton oil services company was " would n't do anything in iraq".
35 - number of countries to which the united states suspended military assistance after failed to sign agreements giving americans immunity from prosecution before the international criminal court.
87 - percentage of american families in april 2004 who say have felt no benefit from bush 's tax cuts.
$300m - amount cut from the federal programme that provides subsidies to poor families so can heat their homes.
more like the french than would care to admit
28 - number of vacation days bush took in august 2001, the month received a 6 august presidential daily briefing headed "osama bin laden determined to strike us targets."
no fool when comes to the press
ugh my dad is so stupid... just does n't understand anything!
have 5 sisters and so including my mom... is the only guy in a house of six females.
now 'm the youngest and just got my period so now all have ours and thinks 's a good thing?
's always like "ohh must be so happy to finally have yours, wish had mine!" and is n't even joking.
think just living in a house with so many girls is making him go crazy?
do n't blame him please, feels lonely and wants to show his attention to all of you to look after you, please forgive and sympathy if miss something.
am sorry for him, is a good dad
no one employs people from hartpury because of what received on work experience.
merrist wood ('m there on a nvq equine course) do hnd in equine management.
hartpury college ( think that is the name, but if type it in should come up with an alternative suggestion), in gloucestershire.
go onto the ucas website, go onto course search and search for the courses want to do.
'll give you a comprehensive list of all the universities that do the courses want, plus all the information need to apply.
should n't ask this question 's intimidating, if tell you what people knows about philippines will blush, thank god many thinks 'm japanese just because of the way keep myself, the way talk and treat people, and the way dress, so if do n't want nasty, insulting answers especially from those undesirable migrants like puttagenius, caloy, gro science, and irene.
in fact philippines is famous to accept people like these people mentioned whose not filipinos but helping the philippines to plunge in the pit as are the rot of the country.
would recommend living in limerick as a student?
've been given the opportunity to live in limerick, ireland, next year as part of my course..if know about limerick, what are the pros and cons?
and would recommend it as a student?
limerick 's a great student city, there 's loads on, 'll be spoilt for choice.
in fact, probably wo n't ever want to leave.
s now my home.
my mytouch 4g crashes with most custom roms install.
really like the miui, but a process crashes repeatedly about every 3 seconds.
and ca n't even load the newest version of cyanogen mod.
not by the company... as voided your warrenty by installing custom roms
are best to either recover to the standard rom, or find one that does n't crash.
have tried using clockwork recovery?
also could use a stable rom like bugless beast and baked snake.
or could just use a home screen launcher replacement.
would recommend go launcher or adw launcher.
are both excellent and speed up the phone quite a bit.
as a mytouch 4g owner know the phone is pretty fast and their is no point installing a rom.
hope read through this.
and how big are?
m 33.
ve never been to the yorkshire moors or penines at all... can see the penines in the far distance from my bedroom window.
when watched werewolf in london ( great film) that was the only time saw the yorkshire moors.
can be bleak and eerie, often very exposed, often covered with antiquities like bronze age burial mounds, stone circles and settlements--until late in the bronze age were rich farmlands,then a change in the climate caused the skies to cloud over and rain to wash the goodness from the soil.
can also be very beautiful when the purple heather is out, and are habitat to much wildlife and many species of wildflowers.
seems to lope one stride and trot the next and repeat...
how could work with her to get off her four hand,get balance, and lope smoothly and slowly??
put on a pair of spurs and before makes that trot step, 's in the feeling when feel her think trot, tick her with the spur and lift with your body to keep her moving.
if concentrate on that feel just before the trot can figure it out and the timing is essential to push her at that instant.
is a gud option for casual/formal functions photography?????
is comparable to sony products or not??
has 14 mega pixel camera...n 4xwide optical zoom...
is def worth more than the price.
am very satisfied.
my answer is that do n't to text speak here... type in english.
just want to ask.. have an nikon dslr..m wondering why if zoom my picture zoom like almost 200-300percent.. can see some dead pixel...is there something wrong with my camera body?
please help me..and what should do to fix this problem?
or is normal?
are sure is n't dirt on the sensor?
take a photo of a very light plain subject close to the lens using long exposure and smallest aperture have - over expose by a couple of stops
will see in the image if there is dirt as that will be the only thing in focus
if apply for a skilled migrant worker s visa and is accepted do have to find work in the same sector as your skills on your application or can take up other work if ca n't find something in your own field.
have posted this question on the nz visa site and ca n't get any info, does anyone know.???
that would be preferable but does n't matter, could be something similar
depends on the conditions of your skilled migrant visa.
your visa should say whether or not are restricted to work in a specific sector.
if your visa does not restrict you from taking any work in new zealand then can work in any sector.
only matters if received an offer of employment or if are currently working in new zealand and used that job in your application to get your skilled migrant visa.
take the red line to clark, then turn right.
not necessarily the restaurant but what order when get there and what time go.
can order appetizers rather than a full meal and have just as good a dinner.
check out http://www.restaurant.com lots of restaurants can look at the menu and check out prices.
not that there is anything wrong with that because also employ local people that live and shop in the area.
found a poor little mouse walking around in my friend s house, and since was able to catch it very easily (normally mice move at the speed of light), and since was acting unresponsive, thought was infected with mouse poison, since my friend uses it.
know that the mouse will probably die, but was wondering if there is any cure for mouse poison?
just hate to see the poor dears experience a slow painful death that way :( .
or, can put the animal in a snap trap designed for rats or mice since that is the only really humane kill method for invasive animals.
so have a very long list of people want to make xmas gifts for and one of them is my best friend.
loves giraffes and homemade things!
am very artistic so decided was going to make her a giraffe sculpture.
do n't have much money so bought crayola air-dry clay.
have sculpted the giraffe laying down.
the key is... have a few problems:
1. tested it out by making a figure boat
and after 4 days when dried was very fragile!
2. what kind of paint do use to paint the giraffe?
3. is there any cheap way to give it a shine like made it in a kiln?
air dry clay works on armatures , the clay has a minor shrink percent, so can leave the wire armature inside, paint with acrylic paint
have a 3-4 month old kitten and live in forida.
am going to my grandma s in north carolina and are going camping in a cabin in west virginia.
my cat is a outside cat but loves it inside.
is also good in a carrier.
should bring her?
if so how quick will adapt to a litter box inside?
took our cat mitten camping.
but was an inside/outside cat (only one owned - rest have been 100 0nside cats).
was trained to a harness/leash for outside time but knew to use the litter pan inside.
if your cat is not trained to use the litter pan, may have a problem taking her.
changing its surroundings too often will stress it out and will get depressed, mean, sick, or will not want to be around you.
what cleaners should use for dusting around my parakeet?
what cleaners can use to dust around my budgie.
your best bet would just be a swiffer duster -- do n't require cleaner.
if must use a cleaner, pledge should be fine if the area that keep your parakeet in is well ventilated.
have had parakeets for a very long time, and use pledge.
agree w the answer from nothing.
even a cotton cloth ( like diapers) that is barely damp w water will work fine.
use miracle cloth, 're fantastic, just do n't use fabric softener or dryer sheets when cleaning them, ruins their "grabbing" ability.

want to buy a laptop for my girlfriend in ireland,would be able to just use the dongle uses for her pc and put it straight in the laptop and work like normall?

yes of course can....
have many friends that have laptops bought in the uk that use them here
how do take care of my newborn baby fish?
am nervous that my other fish will eat them, and do n't know what to feed them!
have counted around 25 of them and currently reside in a 20 gallon tank.
could move all the babies into a fry net breeder or move all of the bigger fish (also the parents) to a different tank to avoid the babies getting eaten.
s natural for some babies to be eaten by adults and if all of them survived your tank would be very overcrowded.
what kind of newborn fish have?
some parents would not eat there fish till a certain age jack dempsey for example would not eat there offspring till mature but would move the baby fish into a smaller tank and feed them flakes
have a question about mcdonald 's monopoly!
if can?
ok, know that mcdonald 's has monopoly going on right now.
& wan na know what food has the game pieces.
when most of the food or drinks got only included two!
so can somebody please list all of the food that includes the game pieces, and the number of game pieces get with that food!
scroll down and this website shows each thing can buy (:
bit of a stupid question but do the spikes/spines (whatever call them) on their side and face area ever go hard.
or are just supposed to look like are so nothing will try to eat them
v owned beardies for ovr 3 yrs and handle mine all the time.. do nt go hard lik eneedle hard but ar nt pillow soft.
use them to look prickly.. would try to eat a cactus [if had no knife] know wouldnt.
puff out to look bigger and badder and can scratch you a lil if r holding them to tight :)
re not really hard.
'm assuming 's to scare off predators / like how will puff up their neck spikes to make them look bigger to predators or enemies.
just are there as an adaptation.
is a curb bit with a ported mouth piece and some horses appreciate this to give them more room in their mouths for their tongues.
is not as precise as a pelham bit because only uses one rein, though the modern ones have two or three slots on which to put the reins.
just gives you a little leverage and curb pressure.
's nice for horses that need a little more than a snaffle.
know that 's vague, but depends on the horse.
the rider needs to have independent hands as well, because do not want to pull too hard on a bit like that. ;)
want to save up for a canon t3i, around 750-800 + :(
'm currently 12 and get about 20 dollars a week for lunch, sometimes a bit more, plan to save 10 dollars every week :)
my birthday is in november and get about .... 150 or more since hate my dad s family.. haha
can someone cunclude how long might take me to save up for the canan t3i or some extra tips to save/gain money? :o
be happy get a bit, many of us never got nothing :)
's around $100 less, which means get the same camera but quicker!
if ca n't even do basic math, 'll never figure out how to use a dslr camera properly.
does the pop drying time slow down if not exposed to air?
s for a craft project..... want to use it the way would use icing....
took a bit of searching to discover that pop is probably pop - plaster of paris and yes plaster of paris will slow way down if is not exposed to air - in fact, if are building up plaster ("the way would icing") to do sculpting, which is rather uncommon, keep the set plaster damp in order to add more unset plaster or have to wet the area where will be adding plaster "mud"
- chemically sets - gets warm to hot then cools down and hard and
- dries out, losing the water that is soaked into the set structure
for example, a set plaster mold that is to be used for clay slip casting must be dry - gets wet pulling the water out of the slip - while a set plaster mold used for molding wax must be soaking or damp wet http://www.mikegigi.com/castgobl.htm#lggobproj
'm getting a dwarf hamster tomorrow and was just talking to my mom and said that have to take out the wheel at night because would disturb her sleep but told her no because said r energetic at night at my room is right next door to hers but heard their are wheels that do nt make noise at all what would be the price of it?
'm quite sure , do n't even have to buy another , all need to do , is to pour some oil on the wheel , or even put some rubber on it's edges , the part that is making the noise .
have a dwarf hamster who hates his wheel and does n't use it -
makes so much more noise, as plays and digs and jumps (seriously)
how can change my boarding station against the ticket booked a month back from counter?
my origin station is howrah, but want to board at asansol..
if yes, do n't need to change it because board later.
if no, 'll have to go to one of the train stations.
in calcutta there is a foreigner 's reservation office where speak english very well.
do n't remember near which station is though.
can help you and is close to a train station in calcutta so check a few big ones?
even if do n't find the foreigner 's office 'll be fine in the normal reservation office of any big train station.
this is where can get and change express train tickets.
might end up as a no show passenger.

no one 's going to take you seriously if 're full of typos and whatnot.
sorry, would put that application in the round file.

how do prevent a dwarf hamster escaping from the cage?
m getting a dwarf hamster tomorrow and saw videos on youtube of escaping and if my hamster escaped because my mom will freak out!!!
would help getting an aquarium cage or a plastic see through box so ca nt escape can buy it a wheel
've never had a dwarf hamster but 've had the same problem with my pet rat put some chicken wiring around it the got from home depot and now ca n't out.
yes 've had 53 different kinds of rodents and two were dwarf hamsters flatten into a pancake and slide right through the bars and are able to open the door so yes a plastic cage will be good
this is the cage have whhich is pretty much impossible to escape from:
love this cage, 's easy to clean, very spacious and fun for the hamster
am 17 years old.
do not get along with my family.
dislike this urban society and want to leave this whole enviroment.
am very unhappy here.
do n't know the best way of doing it.
would be best for to finish college?
live in london.
want to go travelling.
my parents do not like me, constantly reassure me that will throw me out of home when turn 18.
do n't particularly want to stay with them atm either.
but right now s the most convenient thing to do.
anybody is open to answers but would much prefere somebody with traveling experience.
want to go all over :) do n't have a set route yet.
can always beg for spare change when you get hungry.
always thought mayko or meiko is a japanese name.
the canadian regenesis actress mayko nguyen has japanese connection or is her fake name?
right, could n't find any proven source for that.
in vietnam, when a baby was born, must be named "first name" according to that of their fathers.
's principle except a number of cases, for example, the babies are orphans or not to have father.
but if the babies were born in american so would named in other way but still remain "first name" in order to recall about their origination.
'm pretty sure that mayko is japanese.
is a canadian born vietnamese.
'm not sure where her first name is from...
have a splitter/filter between my adsl and ph line?
have 2 phones running on the same line and the adsl which is connected to one of the phones and the filter, 'm still getting a buzzing noise even when have disconnected the other phone without one.
why is stil doing this even though do n't have the other phone connected?
woud be better if got another filter and connected the other phone as well?
if everything is filtered, and still have this problem - try changing the filter - if is still there, try doubling up on the filters...
need either a filter for each device except the dsl modem, or a whole home filter which filters all the jacks, except the one which the dsl modem connects.
've modified my holga 120 to take 35mm film and know that ca n't wind the film back, have to open the back of the camera (in a darkroom) to rewind the film.
what do other holga owners do when need to change film when are traveling?
do just take a changing bag with you?
's light proof and makes sure get no problems when opening the camera.
can work comfortably and make sure your film is not scratched etc.
's really difficult to find a place that is absolutely dark and accessible to you when 're outside.
have a few how to videos for diy 35mm film in a 120 camera on my youtube channel:
'ma sophomore in highschool doing a presentation on italian arts and my teacher is making us censor the statue of david.
my argument is 's art and therefore should not be censored 's making us censor it who 's right
no,'s only a body of a young man
an art teacher in the mid-cities area of dallas/ft.worth metro got fired because took an art class on an approved field trip with parental permission for each student and some hysterical parent discovered that saw "nudes" in the museum.
do n't think was because of female nudes considering the nearly naked girls/women seen at pools and beaches and the completely naked manikins that show up in store windows in malls during changes in display?
no, was guys.
let her do it - argue when are of age and can battle the other adults in your community - skipping of course telling your boss/she is a prudish ignoramus because want to keep your job.
am taking my wife out for our first year wedding anniversary and both agree that want a good steak.
have spent the afternoon looking around from menu to menu...
have also looked at the photo galleries for an inside look at the decor of the restaurants and have narrowed it down to three establishments.
have never been to any of these places so any suggestions and or advice would be most welcome.
's narrowed down to butcher and singer, davio's, and del friscos.
sidenote... am familiar with the capital grille, barclay prime, the palm, the prime rib, mortons, ruth chris', etc.
have weighed those options and found the three that have chosen to be more my wife and my own taste.
please only reviews on the three mentioned earlier.
am only familiar with morton 's and ruth chris.
have never eaten at the ones have listed nor do know of anyone who has.
hope get your answer.
if space is minimal, or are keeping him in there to be kept away from other pets, then can understand why would choose to keep him there.
when take a warm shower and build up steam, his cage will collect water, the bedding will absorb much of it, and will not be able to absorb the urine quite as should.
will also have to be wary of mold forming on any toys or hide-aways may have.
also do n't want it getting too warm for him too often.
overall, is not a good solution, but can keep him healthy and pull it off if take the time to give him the extra care will need because of it.
may be a problem because the temperature is constantly changing.
would personally put him somewhere else.
'm planning my trip to asia and s.korea is one of the destinations.
's so much fun over there, and 'm positive that 'll love it! :)
's a really huge place over there, and so many visitors/foreigners went to put chains and locks over there!
's so much fun!
( 's indoors and outdoors!)
('s all outdoors and the pictures are only a fourth of the real everland!)
s really amazing there, ll blow your mind
's almost like paradise there
found an injured pure white bird (dove guess?)
what do feed it?
found this pure white bird in my neighborhood, its wing is injured, so 'm currently taking care of it.
's pure white, no marks or streaks or anything, do n't know what type of bird is, probably a dove?
what should feed it?
(because apparently my mom is very picky, says the bird might get sick if does n't eat the right food) is there any specific food might find at any pet shop?
doves are a species of pigeon , are seed eaters, do not eat bread,or worms.
make sure that have a shallow dish of water for it.
as can drink a lot.
s jack s aquarium and pets believe. ?
anyways feed them to my road sometimes.
if have a pet store near buy some wheat,pigeon corn or even mixed bird seed will do,but do not feed bread.
how do get to paris cdg airport to paris montparnasse?
have two options
if not what transfers should get on?
as recall, this bus drops you off near the opera in paris.
'll still have to take another bus or the metro down to montparnasse.
use gimp and s not cutting it, looks terrible.
any programs that use please list :) thx
could also try this in gimp.
will give you a lot more power, as well as control over how your black and white photo looks:
open your image while 's still in color
but best is obviously photoshop cs5 or ifr on a macbook there s aperture :)
depends what want from "b&w"... many programs will use a generic b&w...
want to go to thailand to do my boob job from south africa but looking for the cheapest surgeons yet also good in his artwork on a human s body .
cheapest surgeons work out of some small clinic and do not have the skills are looking for. .
do really want to put your faith in some clinic doctor.
know wouldn't.
need to check with one of the major hospital that performance this procedure like bumrungard hospital or yanhee hospital.
would choose the cheapest brakes for your expensive race car or maybe the cheapest parachute too?
when have invasive surgery could also get infections, accidental nicks and cuts that cause other problems too!
if screw up could be in worse shape than are now!
do outstanding work.
when open a can of meat with gravy licks off the gravy and lets the meat lay.
must through it away .
if knew what kind of "meat" put in canned cat food 'd understand this.
've had a lot of cats who refused to eat the canned food.
when read the label s easy to understand why.
've had cats for 35 years and only feed them dry food.
have done very well and like the dry food better.
had better nutritional value and s also less expensive.
canned food is often suspect as to the actual contents and 're paying for a high moisture content instead of food content.
'll also have less spoilage.
might be sick take him to the vet to see
if always does this, welcome to the club.
my oldest female and youngest male do this - just grab the blender and pop in some other stuff for them like chicken liver (cooked) for the anemic one, some arthritis stuff for the oldest.
even if mash it with a spoon ca n't do that,
love how really depends on how good a horse your horse really is, not how talented is.
if took some olympic-level horses on a trail ride, just could n't do it.
does n't matter how graceful your horse is, or how high can jump, or how well does a sliding stop.
what matters is how well trained is, and how good your bond it.
that is another reason why like competitive trail riding also.
have to spend the time training.
those are just a few reasons why love trail riding, competitive or not.
same, when 'm galloping in an open space like that can just forget everything.
seeing the nature and wild life that if keep quiet can get up close and personal.
have had several close encounters with both foxes and wild deer.
also woodpeckers were pecking in the trees and just sat and watched.
have a 10 gallon nano reef with 10 lbs of live fiji rock, and 10 lbs of live carribean sand.
am aware of the maintenance involved in keeping a tank this size.
am currently maintaining a gravity level of 1.024.
have a 10 gallon filter on it.
also have a powerhead, getting another soon.
have a few questions, first want to start a sump filter, but have no idea on how the water intake and water return would work.
how would need to set a sump for this 10 gallon?
do need a protein skimmer or any other equipment?
unless the tank has a built in overflow box (which 'm certain doesn't) then have to get one of those hang on back overflow boxes so that can install a sump.
on the other end of the sump, would have a small return pump with a hose that puts the water back into your tank.
if 're going to go through the trouble of creating a sump for this tank, getting a protein skimmer would n't be a bad idea.
the hydor slimskim nano is a good nano protein skimmer, 's an in-tank design that could easily sit in your sump.
from what understand 're pretty much the same thing.
some of the major differences see is the hd video, longer battery life, and faster processor that the nook tablet boasts.
do n't want an ipad or kindle.
just want an e-reader that does a little bit more than just read.
yes, know about the kindle fire but that 's not what want (: does make sense to shell out the extra fifty dollars?
well recently bought the nook color, and have to say that am very happy with it.
is like a mini tablet itself!
so say should go for the more updated nook tablet.
'm pretty sure 'll be worth it.
judging by nook tablet 's processor 's supposed to be quite faster!
basically nook tablet has more memory, better battery life and a better processor and a microphone.
hey there, 'm trying to find a restaurant in philly to take my husband tomorrow for his birthday.
's pretty much an " love american food, good drinks on occasion, laid back." kind of guy. ;)
want to take him somewhere where there 's going to be awesome burgers/american food, atmosphere (preferably a tavern/pub style would be nice), good service, and all around a great time. =)
'm looking for suggestions from anyone who knows the philly area and the where to's.
oh my, asked this question at the perfect time.
is all about this very subject ... bars and food.
lists places all over the city and suburbs.
if 're looking for a good burger, some great fries ( are too die for!), and good drinks, go to chickie & pete's!
oh my gosh, are great!
if go, make sure order the crab fries, wo n't regret it :)
'm getting a 10 gallon for my betta tomorrow and just want to know how to properly set it up.
'm still a beginner.
any and all suggestions on what need to do and buy will help.
when get the tank make sure wash the inside (with plain water) then wash the gravel (with only water too) take out all the stuff that is floating on top.
add the water and put water conditioner into the water.
if everything is looking good may add you betta to its new home.
lights are optinal since fish need the light turn off at night anyways and an air pump is not nessasary since get air from the surface.
ask the people selling you the fish how should set it up, would know
add aquasafe with the water put in it.
make sure if get new fish that get along with one another.
is possible to shoot lazers out of your wang?
would like to learn how
see re still recovering from the accident.
appear to be feeling better though.
know that there are pros and cons to laser sights before mount them on your wang.
while are extremely accurate, laser sights do not operate well when drunk or high because the beam often does not show up on the target.
therefore, must learn to shoot manually.
have two screws that attach the sight to the wang.
have to mention that recently separated the father into another cage close to the 'nest cage' because and the mother were fighting.
was so eager to go in the nest and feed the baby and always would go right away in the nest after him and give him a fight right there, were the baby was too.
feeds well the baby on her own, the baby is ok but does not go in the nest to stay with him at night...
have to say that the baby does not scream after her of anything.../she sleeps.
budgies are breast feeding birds and may be the male is bisexual.
when the male gets his titts out the female gets mad with him knowing ca n't produce milk.
's fine - just make sure that the room the cage is in is kept warm.
if the baby is feathered yet - which 'm sure is mostly - should be fine.
can text from canada to the united states?
ok maybe that is n't the right question, but my question is can text from a united states number whenr in canada, can send texts to another united states number?
and do get charged for it?
m sorry if could n't say the question right.
hope somebody understands what mean
will, however, cost a bunch.
the phones and networks are compatible, so the only reason would n't work would be if have, say, a cheap cell phone company..
yes can, but will cost you lots of money unless have an international plan.
ye$ can text in canada to the u$ on a u$ number.
varie$ company to company.
may want to get a temporary phone for your trip to canada.
email usually free if use a wifi connection.
$ometime$ is hard to explain that are making an international call and all of the phone companie$involved what $ome of your money.
hope unde$tood the me$$age do have an "s" key on my computer.
need help with my syrian hamster !!!?
hi, bought my syrian hamster (fernando) just yesterday and as was told to leave
to get to know his new home.
as asked in the previous questions was jumping up the sides of the cage but was told is just becouse is panicking and wants to escape but is ok now.
why, how can build up realtion ship with him is also not useing the thing that runs on and wakes up walks around and goes to sleep again ???
secondly, that is normal behavior as use the wheels in the night.
willl eventually come and explore it and them can handle him a little bit.
only got him yesterday.
once has properly settled down, got use to the new smells and noises will be fine.
once is more comfy with his surroundings, then can start handling him and getting to know each other more.
so just needed to know if is a suitable place to live in and in what ways.
also that, heard in the next few years fujairah would be as good as dubai, is true?
'd be happy if someone helps, especially someone who has been to fujairah or lives there. :)
live there!
... ve been living in fujairah my entire life and must say that is developing in a good way.
think 2012 is going to be a great year for fujairah as have alot of projects to be done by 2012.
s between sea and mountains so can camp on beach or between mountains!
... fishing, jet skies, snorkeling, diving are some of the things can do for fun.
and now are finishing a road between fujairah and dubai in 45 minutes only!
so, no is not as good as dubai, but s quieter and more peaceful, and can still go to dubai in 45 mins.
please let me know if need anything else
do n't know the economics of fujairah but dubai is basically bankrupt so would n't want to end up like them!
unless have a particular skill need - and firm job offer before going - would think twice about it!
do n't know should buy ps3 or x-box kinect.
'm a little afraid when buy ps3 or x-box then a newer version comes out.
no matter when buy will get a newer version.
feel x-box is a very smooth system own it like 3 years, s very compatible to previous versions and mostly important was very comfortable with the user interface and the joystick....coz do nt wana hold a joystick that gives you discomfort.
performance - get the same in all, just get a good tv.
do n't know about the playstation situation but do know that microsoft has said do n't see the xbox 360 as being even halfway through its lifetime.
since released kinect this was kind of their way of releasing a new xbox so do n't plan on making another one for a while.
do know have already announced a new wii though and do n't know what sony has said about playstation but again, if get an xbox (which personally think is the best anyways) should be set for a while.
in fact every once in a while seems to get ill in one way or another; and then bounces back like nothing has happened.
did an internet search to ascertain how long cats can live, however different sources give wildly different lifespans.
is on his last legs or is conceivable that could be around for another 15 years as is claimed by some of the sources ve been looking at?
ve had cats for 35 years and the oldest cat 've ever had was a 23 year old female and was exceptional.
knew a cat that died in its sleep aged 21.
thought that had gained my cockatiel 's trust, but now 's not coming to me when open his cage.
what do do?
birds are hard to gain trust with, but 's lost so easily!
a simple hand gesture could have resorted to being afraid of you.
keep his cage open and go on your computer, or read a book, etc and maybe will come out to you.
this with ruin your bond, and probably wo n't have another chance to build one.
might never be a cuddly, loving, tame bird, but can still have a friendly bond.
but then again could be!
like my dogs, really like me and trust me, but when open the door to get them outside, run from me, know 'm going to take them outside and do n't like it.
the bird must know that when open the cage door means that will put him in the cage, and birds do n't usually like cages.
so, do n't think the bird do n't trust you, but still do n't like the cage.
hi m a big fan of breyer horses!
my breyers need stables or barns though.....and need directions and materials on how to make them.
would like maybe 5 stalls per barn so make sure the stalls are not that big so can fit.
and need to know where to buy the materials.
please make this as simple as can for my dad does nt really not that good.
note:if see a answer that love will make my best right there and then
figure out how many stalls want, then measure square cube sections for length and width of horse,
there are many small details, that would have to work on as go for doors and windows and roof,
check hobby shops and craft shops for small pieces of stock wood panels and wood blocks parts, want carpenter wood glue, clamps, possibly small screws to hold corners together, miniature hinges, tape, paint, saws, drills, pencil ruler, paper, bryer horses
wood can vary from cork wood or balsa wood, or press-board, or plywood, and pre-cut 2by4 or slats, can check home depot or hardware shops for larger pieces,
how can get my kitten to stop biting when plays?
have a kitten who just turned 3 months today.
's a good kitty, just when plays bites really hard.
almost every day 'd even wake me up like 5am in the morning, trying to bite my arm.
and when move it guess figures 'm playing. x.x
read somewhere that have to hold his mouth together, and keep it that way til panics.
do think 's teething?
's getting out of hand.
yeah, thought that the holding his mouth thing sounded wrong.
no worries, did n't try.
does have toys, a scratching post, lots of mice, balls, yarn, a feathery birdy toy, etc.
'd just randomly walk up to you and start the biting.
when put him off of my bed, jumps back on and same thing.
may be teething but do nt think can be stopped.
maybe buy him toys that can play with that give him a way to use his energy up
yes do not hold any animal s mouth shut wil close their air way, s just a kitty and are very rambunctious , get him toys.
lots of them, feather ones work best, also when bites you in the morning put him down off your bed, to show him that will not tolerate that, will get it, s also probably teething, so toys are your best bet
hi, want to get a few pet rats and need a rat cage.
(apart from the wire flooring which am going to cover) which of these two cages is better:
ca nt decide between height or width.
always want to go higher rather than wider for rats.
love to climb.
if use this cage 's best to remove the wire shelves altogether and replace it with hammocks and the like.
used one of these cages short term for a pet and was n't that great to be honest, pretty cheaply made, the door springs are annoying and does n't last very well.
these are all a bit more expensive than your choice but if ebay search the names may be able to find one second hand...better paying for a second hand one in good condition than a poorly made new one imo.
have this exact cage, bought from the exact ebay user.
s really good and the rat calculater says is big enough for 5 rats, but would put a maximum of 4 in it really :)
was reading the package for a tank heater bought for my 40 gallon tank for my snake and said can be put under the tank or on the side.
from my understanding, if s heated from the bottom, my snake risks burning its belly if burrows and rests directly on top of the glass over the heater unless buy some of that reptile carpet to put under the substrate, but has better heat distribution
if s from the side do nt have to worry about propping it up, but the snake can still burn itself if slithers along the side of the tank and also read that does nt distribute heat as well?
use uth's on all of my burrowing snakes.
will move if get too warm-'s not like a heat rock which should avoid at all costs.
usually put my own natural rock over the uth and are perfectly fine.
have over 40 corns, kings, and milks and have never had a problem with the uth system.
now use a 75watt basking or heat bulb for mine and seems to like it
put the heater on the snake will love it and the the next day will have dinner
my bday is saturday :) and wan na have breakfast/lunch with my fam.
was gonna have a dinner party that night but my cousin is having having her bridal shower so brunch is but the only places know are denny 's and ihop.
oh and btw live in los angeles look for places in like the lb area and torrance etc thanx ^_^
would strongly suggest "the breakfast club" in chicago.
can definately plan on a great meal with reasonable prices.
have fabulous french toast too.
if 'd rather dine at home, simply call in your order with our take-out service.
're at the corner of hubbard and noble.
unless plan on being late for the bridal shower might want to post this again in the l.a. section.
after the sinking of the titanic in 1912, was there a law made so that ships would carry enough lifeboats to save everybody on a ship if was sinking?
sorry, 'm just very nervous after watching the movie.
today, is the primary safety law affecting virtually all ships, regardless of country of registration.
if ever go on a cruise ship, will be required to attend a solas muster drill (lifeboat drill) within 24 hours of sailing.
are much safer today on board ship due to solas, and suppose if any good came out of the titanic tragedy, the adoption of solas is probably it.
do n't think so
when was the last time heard about a ship sinking?
what are some fun things could do while in japan?
'll be in okinawa for about a week so was wondering what are some fun things could do?
'm a 20 year old female travelling by myself so could be anything.
besides the obvious tourist spots which already have planned for.
does n't have to be underground could be any type of music.
the best thing can do in okinawa is to go to a beach.
otherwise, can do what can do in other parts or japan, like shopping, eating, etc.
or can visit temples or shrines in okinawa.
well first can try speaking japanese.
can find all sorts of fresh food and get a really delicious, fresh sashimi/sushi lunch upstairs.
try the local sake too if can.
's a special kind.
'm not sure that there 's much nightlife in naha.
's more of a place to go to enjoy the weather, the sea, etc.
might have to make your own nightlife by finding an izakaya (pub) somewhere.
was playing a video game that has a m16 vietnam model, and in the game 's 3-shot burst.
my brother said only had full-auto and semiautomatic during vietnam.
than the troops being issued the weapon were told was self-cleaning, which wasn't.
once the troops started cleaning the weapon properly (even with the dirtier powder) the vietnam era m-16 turned out to be a good weapon for the purpose was being used for.
the screw-up was the kind of things have happen when have bean-counters (and mcnamara was nothing if not a bean-counter) instead of soldiers in charge of the military.
play too much cod ;p
is ok to holiday in christchurch since the earthquakes?
is safe to go to rotarua, since the earthquakes?
'm assuming this was in reference to the january earthquake, do n't worry, was very deep, so nothing was effected :)
as for christchurch, yes the aftershocks are still happening, but these are fairly small - can feel them, but do n't do any damage.
since lots of people are still living there, then must be fine to visit.
'm sure that can find some hotels that are running in the christchurch area, but if not then there would be some in close by towns.
despite the aftershocks would recommend going to christchurch, just for the experience and then can see first hand how things get effected by earthquakes.
(ps. 'm assuming 'll stop off in wellington, and since s summer, may recommend kaffee eis ice creams and gelatos?
just recently discovered them last time was down there, 're very nice) www.kaffeeeis.co.nz
loads of places have geographical hazards, if are constantly paranoid, 'll never get anywhere without a sense of adventure.
yes 's ok.
what size horse do need?
m around 5'2 - 5'4 , 11 years old and m wondering what size horse 'll need that wo nt grow out of quickly?
would say really depends on your riding ability, what disciplines are interested in doing, or plan on doing, etc.
but would go for the base number of 15hh.
's "tall" being 's bigger than a pony, but 's on the small end for a horse.
a taller horse does n't always mean a horse ca n't handle.
also keep in mind whether want to be able to jump up from the ground, if even need to, etc.
just want to be sure can groom and saddle sufficiently and the horse itself is calm enough so that whatever size is, can handle it.
'm5'3-4" and am 21 well will be in nov and my horse is 14.2hh and 's perfect size for me can hop right on with no mounting block.....only with a saddle though haha ca n't bareback, not yet
if do n't want to grow out of it quickly get a 14'2 ..
anything smaller will grow out, anything bigger will be too big and difficult to control and manage, especially when riding.
the iguazu falls are easily accessible and, dependent on your time restrictions and budget, can get to the area by either bus or plane.
am going to try and study aboard but idk where can go can not decide where do think would be the best place to go?
where would go?
have never been anywhere out side my home town charlotte north carolina please help!!!!
speak the language and will have more fun.
will be able to have a good time there.
as 're from the states 'll have much more fun in london.
was told to leave a restaurant because ordered water with my meal (apparently this is "washing down" your food") and not ordering wine.
'll need to have intermediate french to have a good time in paris.
's beautiful and the people are extremely friendly.
used to live in london for 6 months and 's by far one of my favorite places to be in the world ('ve been to 45 countries in 5 years).
however, if 're allowed another option and want a small-town feel, then head to edinburgh, scotland.
lived there for 8 months.
also highly recommend staying with a french family.
did this at age 13 in champagne, france and was the most amazing experice of my upbringing.
also known as the personal travel allowance, traveller s allowance fee, traveller s assistance fund, traveller s assurance fund and numerous other forms of “ have to have wodges of your cash or wo n’t let me fly”.
there is no such thing any more, anywhere, ’s an online dating scam."
just pray that have not ever given this criminal enough information for your identity to be stolen - your full name, birthdate, home address, etc or that were not conned into sending money.
there is no such thing as a bta or "basic travel allowance"-this is 100% a scam-as the first poster said,cut off any and all contact with this person- are not who or what are claiming to be.
the below site from the us government verifies this-'s the same for canada ,too.....
how can make my jack dempsey reproduce?
have a mature male and female are together a lot but never laid eggs as far as know can anyone help me figure out how to make them mate
's the issue, are trying to "make" them mate.
does n't work.
first need a compatible pair.
then need to be mature, that is, old enough, and big enough to breed.
the difference is what need to live, vs what 's ideal for them.
get that right, and will mate when are ready.
ca n't make them mate, can only encourage them.
now feed the one in the breeding tank as much bloodworms, blackworms and/or earthworms as can eat for 3-5 days.
may not respond right away and may fight so ther smaller one can fit in one of hide spaces if gets attacked.
when the male s aggressive behavior stops, is ready to spawn.
the two lay their eggs inside the cave made for them.
have a 1 1/2 year old female calico.
when was spayed the vet had a hard time because only has one uterine horn and said this could mean only has on kidney.
recently has been peeing a lot.
'm talking soaking all the litter box and then some.
is also peeing around the box and somehow gets underneath.
do n't have the money to take her to a vet right now but 's getting to be an issue.
have to scrub the floor 2-3 times a week now.
what could be the issue and can try some home remedies first?
love her and want to help her but do n't know when 'll be able to take her to to vet :( please help.
first of all, am very sorry to hear 're having this issue with your cat. :(
given the chance your cat may only have one kidney, would think the worst case scenario would be kidney disease, which untreated can lead to possible renal failure.
signs of this can be hard to spot, and if this is true in her case will definitely need to see a vet.
in the meantime make sure had plenty of water available to her.
want to apply for canada skilled immigeration program.
got only 63 points while 67 minimunm is requirement.?
can apply with 63 points?
according to the citizenship and immigration canada web site at http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/assess/index.asp , states "note: must meet the minimum requirements for your application to be eligible for processing."
should check for updated information on a regular basis."
and between the time began my research and the time applied, the minimum score did change once.
but got lucky because qualified under another category to become a permanent resident.
good news ... found a web page run by canadian immigration lawyers at http://www.canadavisa.com/canadian-immigration-faq-skilled-workers.html .
here is what posted there
"4. may qualify under the skilled worker category even if score less than 67 points?"
"if the canadian immigration visa officer believes that the point total does not accurately reflect your ability to become economically established in canada, the canadian immigration visa officer may use his or her positive discretion (referred to as substituted evaluation) and approve your application even though score less than 67 points."
sure can apply.
why have a "minimum " if is going to be ignored ?
'm mad and do n't know what to do!
alright, so my dad had been wanting me to check my e mail for a few days but never got around to it.
said was in january but still!!!!
so kept reading and then saw the dates, was from mid day friday and arriving home mid day monday. :(
then think just kind of stopped smiling and just kind of sat there looking at the dates.
do n't get wrong want to go, but for 2 days -_- mean seriously.
are taking a 3 hour flight down to a fancy island in florida and staying only 2 days.
****sigh**** not trying to sound snooty or stuck up but mean really!
a leastr going.!
enjoy those 2 days better then not going at all.!
and will be fun 2 days cause will busy going to a lot of beautiful places, can afford to go so be happy have the money to go. :d
well, mean, do n't have to be mad about it.
at least get to go to florida in january.
and, having only two days makes you realize what have with your family.
enjoy it while can, and then if your family enjoys it can go again for a longer period of time.
if do n't like it, 'll only be two days, remember?
hope have a crapload of fun!
have a look at this, may help.
hope helps!
'm american and am going to the uk for the first time, what should expect?
just need to talk to an another american who has gone to the uk before so that know what expect when arriving at the airport and with going through visa process and everything.
do get your visitor s visa immediately at the airport?
was told that americans automatically get a six months visitor s visa.
do have to go through a medical exam right away?
or do just show them passport and walk through the gates?
have talked to some people that say that a medical exam is an invasion of privacy and other say s a routine thing when entering another country.
honestly have no idea what to expect or prepare for and calling in to get professional advice from either of the embassies costs by the minute- which really do n't have the money for.
do not need to call the embassies to get professional advice.
above is the link to the department of state travel website, which will give you all the info that need, including passport information.
is free.
should be fine with just a passport, unless 're staying longer than six months.
should double check with the necessary embassy before leave though.
am not sure how well planned this trip.
'll have a great time, so no worries there.
just treat everyone else as would want to be treated, and 'll be fine.
what would get if cross a sussex male and a silkie female?
had a sussex male and a pekin female bought 2 silkies what would the sussex female and the silkie females would make ?
if had any pics of your hens would like to see them to compare them to mine thanks?
do n't say what color silkie or sussex are dealing with so ca n't say what color your chicks would be likely to be.
however, can say what features would/could have.
so crossed to a sussex could get a walnut, pea, rose, or single combed bird.
hens make excellent mothers as are bigger, can see better, and are smarter the silkies.
took some photos of my model girlfriend with my nikon d7000.
what do think of these photos?
http://i.imgur.com/s2md2.jpg http://i.imgur.com/t2zff.jpg http://i.imgur.com/xytex.jpg took some photos of my model girlfriend with my nikon d7000 (see links above).
what do think of these photos?
deleting a question where do nt like the answer wo n't get you better answers... refer to my previous answer:
need to learn about white balance, composition, angle, and work on using the camera properly...
[edit - and most be very new to modeling, because does look unsure of her poses)
lol, has posted this so many times today already.
clearly s mad that people know took her pic off the net and 's not his gf
in the photo on the couch, the pillow is resting on clashes with everything else in the shot.
compositionally, this one is not my favorite, would suggest trying a different crop because do nt think cutting her off at the calf looks great.
do like the shadow, though.
my suggestion is to pay close attention to what 's going on in the background and if possible, stand on a chair, get on the ground, do whatever need to do to get rid of distracting elements.
've had a few great shots ruined myself because there was something in the background did n't notice at first.
as far ask ’m aware our most unique custom would be the “country wake”.
my self am one but appreciate that the organization is unlikely to make into the 22nd century.
the irish customs have in our family are; make sinnel cake for easter ,barn brack and col-cannon for halloween.
'm unsure of this, because once watched a commercial of cat food with my cat and did n't react to seeing another cat on tv.
heard that a company (here is a link: http://news.yahoo.com/nestl-purina-releases-commercial-aimed-dogs-183443091.html ) is trying to make a dog food commercial aimed at dogs, complete with squeaky chew-toy sounds, and high pitched sounds that humans ca n't hear.
would n't know-- do n't particularly like scary movies, and have n't tried this with my pet.
although, do n't think that scary movies will affect pets for a long time; am sure 'll forget sometime--or am wrong?
the pictures are broadcast at a rate of about 60hz, which is how fast need to move for to see them as a moving, flawless picture.
so see the pictures flicker slower and there for seems choppy to them.
so chances are that if your dog likes to watch t.v., ’s probably because of the sounds.
hearing is a dog ’s secondary sense, and will discuss that in another blog entery.
yes do.
m pretty sure that do see things on the tv screen because my cat chases things around the tv screen
how much should be looking at for horse transportation?
need one horse transported to shows throughout the 2012 show season, and the location is about 3 hours away from where live.
the place where 'm boarding is not likely to want to take me this far, and do not have any ways of hauling him myself.
so want to hire someone (or multiple people) to transport me to these shows.
if ask how much 'm willing to pay, what is a good price range?
saw a site that charges $0.70 per mile.
impossible to say, but guess would have to work out fuel consumption for the particular vehicle that are using and pay a proportion of that, and some on top for the driver 's time and effort, unless are able to share transport with another or more, that would keep the costs down.
remember that get what pay for.
three hours is n't far, but are doing multiple shows.
some people are willing to take your horse, but really have old trailers that are not the safest in the world.
had my horse transported from ca to wa and came on this big, open stock trailer.
was dehydrated when got there and lost weight.
since then, now use a professional horse hauling service with people who ride with my horse to keep an eye on him, stop every few hours for water, and their trailers all have super smooth suspension.
all horses 've had delivered to me since then are happy and healthy when arrive.
would call bob hubbard transport and get a quote.
even though may not want to use them, will give you some idea of what might cost and what is fair.
make sure the trailer service use is bonded/insured and knows something about first aid.
do have this anywhere?
want to take a cruise around the world.
mean literally around the world if possible.
first of if went alone on a regular cabin how much would estimate would be just a guess.
second is there any way to sort of customize the places wan na go to?
like can pick the destinations?
but if not just say no but hope there is like one out there somewhere.
prices listed, however, are usually based on two people in a cabin, and will likely face some high "single supplement" costs in addition.
may be able to do better on the rates if request competitive quotes via cruisecompete).
2. short of chartering your own ship and crew, do n't see any way could customize your own itinerary.
travelling on your own would have to pay double as cabins are sold on the basis of double occupancy.
however: will pay as if there are 2 people in the cabin, even if is just you.
so any price find, double it figure, $40k at least.
as the southeast asians and philipinos came over, added to the cultures.
the other ethicities were n't well represented in politics yet--or rather, were just breaking the color barrier in the 70's due largely to the more open-minded hippy generation.
was not so long after civil rights laws against discrimination started to have an impact.
never saw black muni drivers, asian police, latino politicians until then.
was an evolution.
did not have big percent of chinese migration until the mid 90s.
had fewer people running across the mexican border then.
had fewer social benefits at that time for people so many immigrants were not counted.
had a larger black population in the 70s than have now but did not have any power until willie brown was elected.
edit: my memory may not be good so might get a more accurate answer from someone else who remembers the time.
am thinking about getting a rabbit as a pet, but my parents said that has to stay outside.
also own two chickens that are kept in a run behind out garage/barn thing.
there is already a little dog house that would turn into a little rabbit hutch being kept back there and was thinking about keeping the rabbit in the run with the chickens, but keeping the chickens in the coop and the rabbit in the hutch at night.
however, in the day time would be okay for the rabbit to hop around along with the chickens?
feed the chickens scraps of veggies and fruits throughout the day, but 's nothing that a rabbit would n't be able to digest just fine.
so, can rabbits and chickens live together as long as have separate places for their food and water?
(the rabbit hutch would have an opening only big enough for the rabbit, the chickens would not be able to get to the rabbit food) also, is okay if the rabbit occasionally sneaks a few bites of chicken feed?
my last rabbit did that a few times, and was fine...
just wan na make sure :) thank!
yes,but be sure that your chickens are all hens( mean not roosters),roosters may attack rabbits or anything see moving,so be aware of that,hens are friendly with almost all kinds of pets!
said live in different cages and are free in day,so no problem,don't put both of them in one cage because rabbits bedding is different than that of hens,wet bedding can cause diseases in them!
yea guess but rabbits a easily escape a pen or another rabbit could get in there and that rabbit could be the opposite gender.
have made a furnace as such, took a clay flower pot with a hole in the bottom put a piece of steel pipe in the middle of it with a cap on the bottom, filled the pipe with brass scrap, surounded the pipe with charcoal lit it off and pumped air through the hole in the pot, everything got red hot but did not melt.
what am doing wrong
would recommend to start with something more simple like tin, pewter, aluminum or zinc, all have a much more reasonable melting point.
'll just echo both other answers.
molten brass is damn hot and usually 's pressurized gas and forced air or oxygen.
even if did melt it, doubt foresaw the issues of handling it and pouring it.
's really too advanced for a beginner, both in tooling and safety.
just the zinc fumes will get you, if do n't take precautions.
pewter is perfect for what are doing, and melts on a stove top.
would recommend to start with something more simple like tin, pewter, aluminum or zinc, all have a much more reasonable melting point.
brass has an even higher melting point than bronze and would think your charcoal just does n't get hot enough.
bet also did take charcoal as is used for barbecue which does not get as hot as real coal (e.g. for blacksmithing needs coal, not barbecue charcoal).
have done a fair amount of metal casting, but never tried to build my own furnace, but think your version is just too small and does n't get hot enough.
have melted small amounts of bronze in a crucible with a large propane torch (much larger than the plumbers torch, but can be run of those propane cylinders can buy for a gas grill).
melt brass and cast it http://www.mikegigi.com/castgobl.htm
might be able to make a version of your setup work, but would take quite a bit of charcoal and a lot of forced air.
use propane with a blower and a burner built http://www.mikegigi.com/meltmetl.htm and http://www.mikegigi.com/firehole.htm
could not find any cafes or food shops that provided halal prepared foods.
s important to their religion that only consume halal food.
even if buy a cake in a baker s can not be too what happens in the kitchen, for example the cake may have been sliced using a knife used for preparing ham.
s simply not just a case of avoiding pork, alcohol and only being allowed to eat halal prepared meat, but the kitchen and its utensils should not have been used for prohibited foods.
all enjoy buying a snack when visiting a town or attraction while on holiday.
s not fair if some people have to go without buying food because no place will provide suitable food for them.
think s only fair that nowadays every town should provide at least one halal cafe or restaurant and hopefully one day every british catering establishment will be halal.
when went to bosnia, all the meat was halal.
will not eat halal meat, so guess what, opted for foods which were n't a meat dish, there were plenty of other options.
could not go to their country and demand slaughter and sell an animal as meat the way prefer to eat it.
when go to another country, live by their way of life and their laws, if do n't like it, know how to get back out the country (but guess our benefits system is too much to throw away, huh).
cafes and restaurants rarely use the same cutlery for different food groups anyway, normally have blue for bakery items, have red for cooked meat, have brown for raw meat, etc - all for food preparation and hygiene policies.
will become eu law in a couple of years.
ca n't dictate what business wants to open where.
if someone thinks there is a business opportunity then will start opening halal only places.
do n't know anything about ball pythons.
when ask my mom says will never let a snake in her house.
has no experience with snakes and has never held one.
did all my research and am well prepared to keep one, 'm 14 by the way
maybe if see how much time and effort 've devoted to researching the animal 'll reconsider.
be helpful around the house to show that even if ca n't pay for it yourself that re willing to work for it.
once 've buttered them up a bit try to get them to the pet store and ask one of the employees to handle the snake showing your mom how gentle and harmless can be.
prove, to your parents' satisfaction, that, not they, will be the one actually taking care of your new pet.
2. save up, and research, so that are ready for your new pet.
if can find a pet at a shelter, or that a friend needs to get rid of because 're moving or whatever, might be able to talk your parents into "giving it a good home" where might not be able to talk them into buying a new pet.
once 're there, ask if can hold a ball python.
once 're holding it, try to get her to touch/pet it...
my snake 's meal is too big, what can do?
just today bought a medium rat for my beloved ball python salazar (name after harry potter).
last time got a medium rat was a girl and my snake handled her easily.
but today, got a boy and realized that is huge!
really do love my snake cause is actually an affectionate cold-blooded creature.
so my true question comes to this, how can knock the rat out?
if threw him against a wall and still conscious will run away, do hang him by the tail so the blood can flush into his skull?
really do need answers and advice, and not insulting answers!!
ould just stick him in the tank and let your snake have a nice hunt for once, snakes jaws detach for this sort of this thing, so why not give her a good hunt, but if do want him knock him d just throw him against the wall or something,, lol do nt know, agree with you though throw him, haha
ok so if youre snake will take pre-killed, can "gas it".
just put the rat in a sealed tupperwear container with no airholes and wait until passes out and dies and then feed it.
if wo n't take pre-killed and usually feed live then could hold the rat by the tail and whack it against a hard surface, like a refrigerator or wall.
do n't like that option though - think 's pretty cruel and i'd not done properly 'll end up really hurting the rat but not stunning him enough to stop possible injury to your snake.
would do the tupperwear idea tbh - easiest and most humane.
could also just wait until the rat passes out for about 1 minute and them feed it - at this point, could still have a bit of a heart beat and be slightly still alive.
my opinion - take it for what 's worth… :-)
am a 20 something gay black male and am looking for suggestions on neighborhoods close to the downtown toronto area.
may consider the gay village on church street, right downtown.
is full of gay friendly "everything".
but, could live where ever you fancy takes you.
for obvious reasons, knowing how extremely difficult is to drive a car in the city, should probably try to be near the subway system.
but, can immigrate?
being an american guarantees you no favours when come to going to canada.
start your process here, if have n't already.
a normal processing time, unless have an advanced degree or a "specified" skill is from 3 - 5 years.
must apply, to become a immigrant, and wait to be approved, by the canadian government.
is a competition, and will be competing with hundreds of thousands of others, from all over the world, for a place in the line up.
if have not begun the application process's now< are about 2 to 3 years away from being approved by immigration canada.
whatever do ...............do not try to come here with out legal permission.
will not be able to seek work or take a job, in canada, with out having to show your immigration visa and canadian social insurance number card to any potential employer.
do it properly, and legally, and will be ok.
have a 4 months shih tzu puppy.
recently 'm having trouble training him.
is kind of hate walking with leash, every time put the leash on, will try to bite it.
and is not following me when was walking.
saw lots of videos about this, but actually did n't help.
and every time see some one will rush to people and jump on them, does n't listen to me.
last thing is every time sit on a chair or something higher than him, will try to jump on, if can't, will bark all the time until let him get on, what should do with this ?
hi, am a dog trainer for 25 yrs.
this way, can not reach the leash to chew it.
when swivels his head to go for it anyway, tell him sharp "uh uh" gently correct him with a small tug and continue your walk.
do this repeatedly and frequently and will learn to walk on a leash.
is a young pup and will learn over time and consistency in his training.
want your dog to admire you as his pack leader, not fear you.
why do nt get some treats that loves and only give him them when does something right.
or, as saw on embarrassing pets on tv, get a clicker type thing and treats as well.
try to train him to heel, which means to walk round you before needs to go on a leash, and may do that.
or could even spray some scented spray on the leash and will go for the scent and probably, if act quick enough, will stay on the leash.
what sort of hotel could expect to find in new delhi/agra/varanasi for rs500 per night?
'm looking to visit india with some mates at the beginning of february next year and am wandering what standard of accommodation could get for rs 500 per person per night.
there would be four of us so would probably be looking at 2 twin rooms for rs1000, close to the centre of these cities.
this would be on a walk-in basis as want to have the freedom of finding a place that looks good (not relying on pictures from the internet) and is in a spot like.
in delhi 'd recommend ajay guesthouse.
must say, in delhi 's hard to get good price/quality rating.
have found this hotel in the lonely planet guide.
's in an area starting with a p, many tourist hotels there and the location is very nice.
in varanasi do n't know.
've stayed in a more expensive hotel there, but can check some travelguides or tripadvisor?
also, while travelling ask people where 've been and if have any hotel recommendations.
in agra 've stayed in a place fellow travellers recommended, found it in the rough guide.
was nice and close to the taj.
was quite easy to find something.
ve paid 500 for a double room there and was fine and clean.
may find a normal budget hotel for rs 1000 per night in the cities mentioned, the links below may help you to find good hotels in delhi and agra.
is in karol bagh.
is centrally situated.
have a hamster, and mice and rats like to escape.
the guinea pig is better because s a lot larger than a hamster, rat, mouse, or degu.
so if lose him, is easier to find, because smaller rodents just love to escape from their cages.
(plus do nt stink that bad)
depends on what want in a pet, to be honest.
also depends on the space have, how much time can handle the pet, how much money can spend, etc.
've had experience with all of those pets except degus.
're incredibly social, highly trainable, and very clean.
the only downside is should be kept in pairs or trios and require a pretty large habitat.
that means expense, space, and require weekly cage cleaning.
, too, need weekly cage cleaning and can cost quite a bit.
could handle my mice, but where skittish and preferred their cage.
have two.
are social and like to be handled.
have to have two because do n't do well alone.
make certain get two females.
two males can fight and definitely do n't want babies!!
will whistle when hear you as an encouragement for to give them a treat like leaf lettuce.
love leaf or romaine lettuce and tomatos, celery, cucumbers, carrots.
do n't feed them broccoli, cauliflower, garlic, onions, head lettuce .... are all too difficult for to digest.
also ca n't eat potatos, are toxic for them.
if keep the cage clean do n't smell and can buy spray on cleaser for them, just massage it into their coat and groom them.
this is my first experience and have two six week old kittens right now and am at my wit s end.
do not want to have to bring them back before are eight weeks old but are ruining my apartment.
track poop everywhere (most disgustingly my bed....), and am constantly trying to climb up everything, including my bare legs!
realize are young and that cats do climb, but this is just ridiculous.
my apartment also smells repulsive even though am cleaning out their litter box at least once a day if not twice.
that 's kind of the way goes..lol.
if have limited options, try the bathroom.
depending on the batch of kittens, will often have as many as one per kitten.
can produce a lot of waste and even scooping twice a day they can get messy.
for some reason takes them awhile to learn not to step in poop.
also if have diarrhea, check in with your foster coordinator.
made need medication or deworming or something.
are testing out their claws and teeth.
to some degree can/should help teach them not to use their teeth and claws inappropriately.
but in the meantime, highly recommend jeans and long sleeves anytime 'll be interacting with the kittens.
get plenty of sleep and make sure take time out to do some things enjoy.
try to go in there with the right frame of mind and enjoy them for what are.
if still do n't enjoy the kittens, see what other opportunities are available.
may need foster homes for adult cats in different situations.. sick, recovering from surgery, need a little socialization, etc.
find the adults are much easier.
generally 're not clawing and biting, do n't make nearly as much mess, do n't need nearly as much litterbox scooping, etc :)
and do more research before agree next time ;-)
depends on if ever registered the birth.
some places do the registration right at the hospital....in some smaller places, need to register your child 's birth at the town hall/registrar's office.
did n't know that did n't register him in the ridiculous amount of paperwork had filled out in the hospital and was supposed to go to city hall within 90 days.
two years later when got around to filling for his birth certificate, find out was never registered.
had to call the office of the registrar general in thunder bay, have copies of the delayed registration form mailed out to me, as do n't have an online area for it yet, fill those out, send them away, then apply for his birth certificate.
if are just applying for a birth certificate for the first time, s simple to do it over the computer.
for $56 can even have it expedited and will get in three business days or your money back.
just need basic information, and answer a few questions like what hospital was the child born at/who was the doctor....
none, just walk in to the service office and present all the identification have to prove your identity.
may then chose to ask you to bring more evidence, or just look up the record and hand you the certificate.
can probably do it all on-line.
start here if were born in ontario.
if were born elsewhere, start here.
my parents did n't send for my birth certificate until was 16 and needed it for summer employment.
was no problem to get provided the birth was registered in the first place.
add that in because there have been some people who have tried to claim citizenship by sending for their birth certificate when were never really born in canada or to canadian parents.
as long as that was done can send for it at any time.
each provincial government has a website that lists the process for that province so depending upon where were born can google it.
only if have been on board *both* !!
for our comparison sailed on two similar ships - the carnival liberty and the royal caribbean mariner of the seas.
usually have the main show and some type of entertainment before and perhaps afterward.
felt that the main shows on the mariner of the seas were better.
if love seeing the shows, royal caribbean was better for the main shows and carnival was slightly better for the comedians.
dining room enjoyed the atmosphere of both dining rooms on the liberty and mariner of the seas.
felt that the menu had a little more variety on the mariner of the seas.
did have one waiter that complained some on one of our trips on the mariner.
had a slightly better experience on the liberty, but feel that both crews did an excellent job and that this should not be a distinguishing factor on choosing a cruise.
both had pools for kids and adults.
if have kids, this would be something that would definitely enjoy.
did not try the spa on the mariner of the seas.
usually ca n't go wrong when getting a spa treatment......
really want to travel when leave school!
where in the states could go?
have every traveled before?
how long should go for to each place?
( have 1 year before collage!)
&also how much money would need?
so can start saving now hehe
mean when graduate & yes, college, sorry for the typo.
not the smartest move to take off on a worldly adventure if 've never traveled before and do n't put where would be traveling from.
what do like to do?
do speak a foreign language?
could spend a year in spain alone.
've traveled to all of these places and could certainly tailor a trip to your needs based on budget, actual time allowed, your likes and dislikes.
do want to see all the sites or simply a few photos and on your way to the next place.
does your budget limit you to how long can stay in each place?
need a lot of money for hotels, airfare, seeing the sites, food, local transport - name it but life costs.
once have a budget or an amount in the bank then 'll be able to figure out where can go, for how long can go and what can do when 're there.
recommend buying a single unlimited europass and travelling anywhere in the eu your heart desires.
ca n't beat the price for what get.
how do make your cat adjust to a new house?
and my family are moving into a new house just outside a small town.
are currently living a mile from the town in a house surrounded by fields but the new house is beside a busy road.
have had the cat for 10 years and do nt want to leave it.
how could make it settle in a new house.
are not just moving house - your cat is losing his territory.
territory is very important to cats, and are very nervous when go into a new place - a new house could be full of predators, or unknown menaces - well at least thinks so.
will need to give him only a small place to explore, so can make it his territory, and feel safe there.
will need to get his box and bowls, and whatever blanket and toys are his, and smell like home, and put him in a room.
will feel much safer in that one room, than in a huge unknown house.
will explore the room, mark everything with his cheek, and try to make it feel like his territory.
will reassure himself that no other animal is in there, and that no other animal will come in - is afraid that is in someone else 's territory when is in a new house.
will be freaked out, so going back to his territory will make him much happier.
extend the time is out each day, but for the first month, always put him in his room at night, so feels safe to sleep.
soon will make the whole house his, but needs that one safe place to start from.
remember to visit with him while is in the room, and tell him how good is.
remember to give him the time needs to feel that the room is his - rush it, and will be afraid of the whole house for a long time.
might even start peeing on things in fear.
in time though/he will adjust. :)
just do it on their own.
just adopted a 2 year old male german shepherd with major bad behaviors?
last night, adopted a 2 year old male german shepherd.
( is 92 pounds) does not listen to any commands, but my major problem is that will not go outside on command, or even with me.
will walk outside and will stand at the door and stare at me or run away.
my other major problem is that will not get in his crate.
will get a treat and try to get him in there that way, wo nt work.
wo nt even get close to the crate.
if come towards him, will run away.
how do train him to feel comfortable in his crate?
wo nt do anything on command.
s very frustrating.
have a 9 month old german shepherd that raised from a puppy.
trained her myself.
is crate trained, potty trained, and can sit, lay down, stay, come, fetch, and will even stay in a down position while throw a treat across the floor or even right next to her paw, and wo nt get it until give her the command.
just do nt know how to do it with a grown dog.
tosses me around like s nothing!
...but basically, what do is the same thing did with my puppy...lots of patience, lots of time, lots of praise, lots of treats, and lots of repition....right?
is there any tricks could use?
have to be in command at all times.
would start with a leash.
let your dog go in when wants to for no reason.
at some point will feel ok with this and can then close the door but not for long at all.
open the door and let him out and see how acts.
if push it, will never work.
will learn to really like this.
have patience with him, just got him and who knows how was treated before brought him home.
where can find the best tours to the mekong delta at reasonable prices?
will only be in ho chi minh for 4 days and am looking for a 1 day or 2 day trip to mekong delta.
have been researching on line and find things are quite pricey but the tours look great.
should just settle and book on line?
or is better if wait till get there?
if wait, would the tours find there for less money be the same quality type tours?
if want reliable and inexpensive... try sinh cafe/tourist.
are located right at 248 de than st. in the heart of the back packer district.
have taken this tour and was great.
did an overnight in a home stay that was sweet and the water market was wonderful.
do n't remember the exact cost but remember thinking how inexpensive was.
and no, do not work for them. :)
am just a satisfied customer.
is a tour agency and have their own buses etc.
there is n't much to see in the delta, 's a lifestyle not a resort area.
if 're adventurous can take a bus or water taxi to my tho (near where live) or can tho.
from either of those cities, can venture out and spend a day in the country.
most of the tourists that 've come across buy tours along the my tho waterfront.
take a boat across the river, then spend a day biking, eating at a local restaurant, buying souvenirs and doing other things that are geared towards tourists.
the countryside is very beautiful, especially if have a few months (or years) to get to know the place.
ps, if make it to thanh pho ben tre, stay a night at my friend ken 's hotel.
's a little hard to get to by foot, 're rebuilding the bridge, but can get someone to moto-taxi you there for a dollar or less.
's an ex-pat from new zealand and 's been in town for awhile.
'll set up a real tour of the area for you, not some tourist fantasy.
have a good trip where-ever end up.
went with intrepid as a part of their north to south vietnam trip, but do offer this one day separately.
mentioned it to my boss and said to start doing yoga.
any good poses or programs ('m willing to buy a dvd as long as is under $20) to help specifically with leg stabilization?
because do n't feel like spending over $20 on a freakin dvd
also have back problems that transfer into my legs.
here is what do now and really helps....
when first get on take 1 leg and pull it back up to touch my butt with my heel and hold it there for 1 lap at a walk around a large dressage arena.
then 1 lap at a walk around the arena with both my legs pulled out as far as can, so are not touching the saddle.
then a lap doing scissors, one leg forward as far as can and the other back, then switch legs.
'll also trot doing, down 2 beats, up one for a wile, then up 2 down 1 making sure the weight is going into the balls of my feet.
if the weight is going into your heels ( throws your leg forward) put the stirrups up against the heel of your boot.
btw do nt want your leg locked in place, will move with the horse a bit.
when first started doing it 'd do it every day.
now just do it once or twice a week or as needed.
what are having problems with?
would n't bother with yoga 'd practice more with riding and fixing my problem, ride bareback, with no irons, there s also a way to ride on your knees?
ya really would n't bother with the yoga
maybe a back brase will help, sometimes my back really gets to me and 've thought about getting one.
with your leg flopping, just try putting all your weight in your heel and hangon with only your legs, holding my leg back helps me with flopping the more 's forward the more flops :/ work your calf muscles, maybe try standing on the edge of your steps (on the ball of your foot) and balance to strengthen those muscles
do n't want to spend more than $20 and yet have an expensive hobby like riding horses?
really ca n't help you.
has been having diarheya everywhere and began to vomit lastnight.
thought would pass until started to vomit blood and would nt drink any water.
took him to the animal hospital and ran blood work and everything came back normal.
the vet said was gastroenteritis and gave him fluids under his skin , an injection of nausea medication along with some take home antibiotics.
is normal for dogs to throw up blood while having gastroenteritis?
have tryed to give him water but wo nt take it.. what should do?
do nt want him to get dehydrated and also should try to give him a little bit of food?
did nt take x-rays offered them but just could nt afford anymore treatment.
feel like shit for saying that but after what have done already wo nt be buying grocerys for the next few weeks.
will give them and call and see what say.
ok so spoke to the vet and said the give him white rice and boiled chicken but only a little at a time.
seince recieved the fluids lastnight said not to worry about drinking water for at least a couple of days.
1) is not normal for dogs to be vomiting, much less to have blood in it.
however, if have been vomiting numerous times, then the blood could be due to irritation of the stomach and intestines.
could also have parvovirus, a gi foreign body, or any number of things.
2) your vet would not prescribe them if did n't think would be helpful.
3) if shows no interest in water, then take him back to your vet.
could be due to nausea or any number of things.
could become severly dehydrated (especially if continues to vomit and have diarrhea).
from there end up with electrolyte imbalances, which can lead to heart and kidney problems.
should have discussed a bland diet with you, including the frequency of feeding and how much to feed at each sitting.
sounds like your dog may benefit from being hospitalized, and put on iv fluids to help his hydration, administer the antibiotics iv, and to ensure that starts to recover.
should absolutely call your veterinarian back immediately to clarify anything have questions about.
have seen your pet, and are most aware of his condition.
need to ask your vet these questions.
my vet told me when a dog is vomiting a lot, could be a sign of obstruction.
did do any x-rays?
do n't know if vomiting blood is common with this ailment.
should call your vet now and ask them what is normal or not.
'm in my 20's and currently studying in france.
however, 've read on the internet that the french dating etiquette is totally different.
are also very secretive about being in a relationship.
only 'go out in the open' once have reached a certain level of seriousness.
is true?
is friendly when see each other on campus.
is also nicer when are both alone.
however, when are at parties or when they are people around seems to ignore me.
also seems to hate whenever ask her out on a date, to the point said stop!
my mind thinks has no interest in me and just stringing me along.
but the articles read seemed to say the contrary.
have just fallen victim in a cultural trap?
what have read in the internet is fairly accurate but of course does not fit all scenarios.
are not french for a start, so the "rules" or "customs" may not apply to you when comes to entering into a relationship between people from different backgrounds.
from what say the messages given by this girl are quite clear.
is not stringing you along since is actually discouraging you and is honest enough to tell you to stop asking her out .
is just being friendly in public because does not want to offend you and treats you like any other friend.
at parties does not want to be considered in any way attached to you, which is consistent.
take the messages for what are: has no objection in being pals at uni, but does not want to take matters further.
"non!" means "non", not " might consider it, and will keep you attached to my apron strings just in case."
have fallen in a cultural misunderstanding.
what have to add is that is normal in france to have mixed gender groups of friends, there 's nothing unusual in boys and girls being only friends, which is obviously what this girl wants from you.
probably finds your company pleasing as a friend but are not her choice a a boyfriend and is trying to keep on a friendship level, and trying to make you understand that does n't want to go further.
if is nicer when are alone 'd say is because in public view is making sure that people do not think that might be her boyfriend.
do find the 'get the number hop in bed with her' but be aware that usually have a reputation as sluts.
'm just trying to make up my mind whether should move to australia or seek work in the sex industry.
'm two years into an undergraduate degree.
everybody know at university intends to stay at uni for as long as possible until there are actually jobs available.
your answer does n't do anything but remind me that 'm going to be $25,000 in debt by the time 'm 22.
really like you're answer.
's very logical.
've also considered becoming a teacher, but 's not a job 'm cut out for.
also wish 'd applied for a scholarship.
did n't think 'd be awarded one, but received the dux litterarum award at high school, so my chances were probably better than thought were.
obviously 'm still completely stupid though.
mean, was n't smart enough to apply for a scholarship.
and yes, am being melodramatic.
*gasps* so would n't make a good prostitute?
are saying 'm bad in bed?
how would know?
your answer is very sweet, but 'm not compassionate towards teenage high school students.
'm studying to be a teacher, so know that there will definitely be jobs out there when 'm done.
may have to live somewhere rural or in auckland, but at least can be pretty sure 'll be employable.
've also got a bachelor s degree so can go back and do further study or take a different profession.
also know that do n't get paid that much more in australia than do here.
and 's not all about how much earn, cost of living is much higher in many cities in australia.
also have to put up with all the annoying accents in australia.
's probably not a wise idea to keep studying and having a massive student loan.
and 'll probably add interest to what 've already racked up.
at the moment if move overseas can only come back to new zealand for a short amount of time before 'll force you cough up.
and all that time 're overseas 'll be racking up interest.
would n't like not having the option to return to nz.
guess 'm extremely fortunate that received a scholarship which paid about 800f my course fees through my degree.
but worked hard and 'm still working hard.
there are far too many lazy people out there who think that can sit around a job will fall in their lap.
'm doing fine.
whilst youth jobs are thin on the ground, do n't assume 's better in oz.
people have been fleeing this country at roughly a plane load per week for the past 20+ years, so 's not anything new.
depends on what hunger for.
have a baby eastern king snake.
have tried everything can to get him to eat but refuses.
has a great environment, with water and lots of hiding places and a heat lamp.
according to the vet, is healthy and looks good.
has been going to the bathroom like should.
( know that snakes that have problems going to the bathroom wo n't eat.)
has been drinking water ( am pretty sure has been drinking it out of his bowl, but also have been feeding him water and does n't ever give me a problem with that - just stick his head near the water and sucks it down.)
handle him every few days.
is feisty, as most king snakes are, but is a very nice little guy - never tries to bite or anything.
just love him to death.
do n't know why wo n't eat though!
have tried feeding him 5 or 6 live pinkies and 4 or 5 frozen (thawed) pinkies.
have never tried feeding him a pinky that was bigger around than is.
have tried putting him in a small container and putting him in a dark place for an hour or so and wo n't touch the pinky.
crawls on top of them but does not try to eat them.
does n't seem to know that are food.
have tried "braining" both live and dead pinkies, and bloodying them up to get his attention, but does n't care.
have tried dipping both live and thawed pinkies in tuna juice, and in used gerbil bedding.
have bought some long reptile feeding tweezers and have tried holding the pinky in front of the snake 's face.
wo nt even try to bite.
has n't eaten in an entire month.
've only tried to feed him one at a time.
's just a tiny baby, about the width of a pencil.
when feed him how many pinkies do feed him?
if feed him too many could just not be hungry.
if does n't seem interested in them at all would say 's just not hungry.
my boyfriend has one and when 's hungry attacks the pinkie right away.
can smell it so 'm sure knows what is and just do n't want it.
have a natural instinct to hibernate.
can tell when your king snake is about to shed, because its eyes will get milky looking.
's natural and so long as do n't see any serious deterioration in their health is nothing to worry about.
see, some snakes for no obvious reason will simply go off their food.
're fit and healthy and their care is suitable.
that 's why 's good to have a python!
's twice my size and eats a rabbit once a month.
have a 1 and a half year old male neutered cat and a new 2 month old spayed female kitten.
the next day let her out of the bedroom so could check each other out, and the kitten hissed twice within the first 20 minutes of meeting each other and now no longer hisses and have been playing(chasing each other up and down the hall, rolling around on the ground and pawing at each other).
only once looked like my male cat was biting at her neck and then her stomach and was meowing fairly loud and hissed once then backed off and now are fine.
or were actually fighting?
has been "biting" at her neck and stomach previously while play without her meowing or anything so m wondering if went a little to far that one time.
did not leave the new kitten in the room long enough.
need to do that for a least a week, or else this type of territorial fighting will happen.
right now, your male is fighting off an intruder, and feels that all of the house is his.
will start to calm down and feel safe - can bet does n't now.
knows is invading someone else 's territory, but ca n't help it, and has no where to go.
will be able to sleep without being afraid.
when the door opens, will get that the one room is hers, and will be ok with that.
give them time to set up their territories, and once bring the new kitten out, pay a lot of attention to the male.
have brought someone else into his territory, and needs to be reminded that still love him, and support his claim to his space.
that will help to reassure him, and will be less aggressive with her.
when play fight, do n't hiss.
if hiss, are not playing.
if bite, and one cries, must separate them, and must keep an eye on them.
hissing is ok, unless start to fight.
putting the girl in her territory will make her feel less afraid, and will relax.
means 've gone too far.
when start bleeding that means 're really fighting.
if 're going kinda slow and like fake biting (not biting as hard as can), and fake scratching (not hitting as hard as can with their paws) then 're playing.
have two cats, and at first hissed at each other because cats are very territorial, but now do fight and play.
that means are fighting.
when are just jumping at each other and their tails are wagging that means that are playing.
refused to believe them and ordered the military to win the war within two to three years (before the next election in 1968).
did not give them the number of troops requested.
thing is, worked.
the arvn was not having a big problem with the local vc (the guerilla movement), were being challenged by the main force vc (which was light infantry) and the north vietnamese army (nva).
when the americans swept in with their search and destroy operations the communists quickly leaned could not stand up to the us firepower, and these regular troops were forced to flee the country and take sanctuary across the borders in laos and cambodia.
could not defeat the americans.
however, what hoped to do during the tet offensive was to sneak past the americans and attack the arvn in the urban areas where were deployed doing successful clear and defend operations.
the communists thought could defeat the arvn, cause the fall of the south vietnamese government, and the people would than rally to the communist cause and leave the americans stranded in a sea of angry peasants.
when give the ultimate choice, rallied…
the people rejected their attempt to topple the government, and for all intents and purposes the us military (and the arvn) handed johnson the victory had ordered them to achieve within the time-frame ordered it.
all had to do for a complete victory was allow the military to go into laos and cambodia and finish off the shattered communist forces.
but johnson was so obtuse did n’t understand had a victory when was handed to him on a silver platter.
instead pulled the military off, stopped the bombing of north vietnam, withdrew from the presidential race, and spent the rest of his term in office trying to surrender to north vietnam.
screwed up by not accepting his surrender when offered it.
to emancipate the south, but was a serious failure.
in that, pretty much succeeded.
tet made clear that the war was a long way from being over if the americans thought could preserve the south and that the north was perfectly willing to suffer great losses to continue their fight.
try google to find the title if would like to read it.
just bought a baby one yesterday.
have a basking spot lamp that says is a double reflector that focuses 35% more light/heat and provides beneficial uva rays important to the psycholical well-being of him.
my question is does that mean gives him not only the heat, but the "sun rays" needs?
also was wondering how long should this light be on.
the lady at pet smart said 4 hours, but on places on the net says 10 to 12 hours.
's getting used to his new home, but has n't eatin yet.
have bearded dragon juvenile food and freeze- dried crickets.
let me try to break this down as simply as can: diurnal (active during the day time) reptiles like the bearded dragon require 3 types of "light," uva, uvb, and heat.
uvb will always be a separate bulb from the heat lamp, unless use a mvb (mercury vapor bulb) which is the only reptile use bulb that will emit both uvb and heat from one bulb.
highly recommend that do not use coiled/compact uvb bulbs as are known to cause severe eye damage and/or blindness in reptiles not to mention have trouble maintaining uvb output over time.
so, to answer your question, no, if just have a bulb that says produces uva then do not have "the sun 's rays" that your bearded needs.
need to also provide a source a uvb lighting.
the person at petsmart is very wrong; in fact is always a good idea to second guess what most pet store employees tell you; do n't have the best track record regarding giving reliable pet care info.
freeze dried food is not a good staple food source; need to offer live feeder insects.
bearded dragons are sight hunters, need to see the food move to trigger a feeding response, especially when are babies.
would highly recommend that read through some reliable bearded guides to make sure have everything set up correctly:
if there are shady areas can move to (for example a 3x5x4 tank with light on one side) then can leave it on a full 12-14 hours, if s a small tank and ca n't escape the light then 4-6 at most at a time though quite possibly 4-6 hours at a time twice a day.
either way also need to keep an eye on the temperature if are using a dry fish tank as uv lights in my experience up the temperature significantly and without proper ventilation can become an oven.
as to what the light provides gives uv rays..which is important for health in lizards as is in humans.
yes, gives him the "sun rays" necessary, that 's what uva is.
and should be on 10-12 hours, just like the sun would be up for 10-12 hours in his natural environment.
also, beardies often do not eat food that is not moving, so s anyone 's guess whether or not 'll touch the freeze-dried crickets or the processed food.
tell all my customers can try it, but do n't count on it.
am making a christmas list for my parents and was going to ask for a bird and these are the affordable ones that like, and was wondering : which would not bite alot, and which are more fun to have as pets and need to know which would be quietest honestly do nt care but my family does !
did the same thing that did for christmas.
ended up getting a pair of zebra finches for christmas.
at first was all cool and all.
were chirping and doing their every day business.
after a couple of weeks got tired of them.
are quite messy and can not hold or pet them.
ve tried to tame them and just would not get tamed.
do nt want to be held or touched.
want a bird that can hold and do tricks.
still have them and are doing well.
a couple of months after got parakeets/budgies.
are adorable have beautiful colors and personality.
love them.
first of all are very tame.
tamed them in 4 days.
can do tricks and are nt messy.
are a big part of our family.
hope this helps you with your decision.
are both about the same noise level.
if want a boy the cere (the nostrils piece above the beak) must be blue.
would recommend that get two parakeets.
sometimes do nt get along ( know how some girls are lol hahahaahh but for real though, two girls tend to fight a lot.
have one yellow girl and a green and yellow boy.
are the best!
if choose to get a parakeet this is a trick that used to tame them.
however if plan on getting one, then get more than one at the same time need company.
my mom told me how to tame them and was very happy with the results.
took me 4 days to get the new one to be able to step on and eat out of my hand.
these are the steps used.
honestly have worked for me twice with my parakeets.
hopefully will work for you.
1) when get the bird, place him or her or them in the cage.
took the cage and place it next to the couch.
then sat on the couch, placed one hand in the cage, holding a millet spray.
(this way will associate your hand with food, and birds love food lol) then turned on the tv and watch.
( can take breaks if have too) and repeat the steps after about 2 hours.
3) after about day 2, will start to eating the millet spray from your hand.
(do not take away the food dish from the birds, will associate you as the person who takes away their food)....
( the first couple of times will fly all over the cage but as long as do nt jump back or screem will get used to you) will have no choice but to go on your finger.
when see that ar nt harming them, will go up on your finger when say up.
4) if are not going up by now just got ta keep trying and keep trying.
have patience.
after a couple of weeks knows when say shoulder means ot go on my sholder, when say up means to jump up on my finger, when say up and out means up on my finger and out of the cage.
and when say go home means to go in the cage.
worked for me and hope worked for you!
are awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
and that s my reason why should choose a parakeet over a finch.
are normally quiet and is easy to take care of them.
are also friendly.
have a parakeet named cookie . :p
graduate in the spring, and so 'd like to go between then and winter.
do n't want too many tourists, and since 'll both be out of school can go anytime between the middle of june to early november.
do n't want it to be too cold (not sure when exactly there fall is... or what the weather is really like there during our autumn months), but do n't feel like need to go right in the middle of summer either.
're both in our early 20s and just wanting to explore the beautiful country while 're still young and before our lives start to get even crazier!
can anyone give me an idea of when the best time for to go to ireland would be?
people do not go to ireland on holiday for the weather, is unpredictable.
one thing can be sure of about irish weather is how little can be sure of.
may be shirtsleeves and sunglasses in february, but winter woollies in march and even during the summer.
the irish weather works on the ‘four seasons in a day’ principle, which basic­ally means that ca n’t predict a thing when comes to the behaviour of the sky.
in summer, from may to july, the days are reasonably warm and – most importantly – very long: at the height of summer wo n’t need to turn on lights until after 10pm.
is also peak tourist season, which means there are far more people just about everywhere but the most remote corners of the island, and prices are at their highest.
still, have a better chance of some peace and quiet, and the weather can be surprisingly better in april and september than in mid-july – again, ’s all part of the uncertainty principle.
crowds are at their thinnest, but many of the country ’s tourist attractions and services close down in october and do n’t reopen until easter, which paradoxically leaves visitors with a more convincing taste of how ireland is experienced by most of the irish: ’s cold, grey and dark by 5pm, but there ’s always a pub to escape into when the rain starts sheeting down.
the thing to do is to bring the right clothing with you, clothes so can layer up if is cold and take off layers when warms up.
afraid can not be more helpful, is really a case of pot luck, although as the weather is so changeable often a cold wet morning will turn into a lovely warm sunny afternoon and evening or visa versa.
if mean the republic of ireland (dublin) then anytime.
the summer there is much more mild than most of the us (are coming from the us?).
their seasons are the same as all the countries in the northern hemisphere but would suggest fall.
does get pretty cold in ireland so going before winter is your best bet.
rent a car and spend a couple days outside of dublin seeing the countryside and will have the trip of a lifetime.
to explore the beautiful countryside will need to be old enough to hire a car because public transport is expensive & only goes as far as the main towns/cities, most rural places do n't have a bus or train service.
could stay in a city & get a bus tour to say the cliffs of moher or dingle peninsula but will be with all the other tourists.
by definition most tourists will go to the best places so might have to put up with a few tourists along the way.
best weather the past couple of years has been around late april - late may but can pour with rain for days on end at any time of the year so be prepared with waterproof jackets/boots etc.
only had a few sunny days this summer, barely 24c on a few occasions, more like 14c most days.
used our bbq on precisely 4 occasions.
the days start to shorten & gets even wetter, windier & colder.
had frosts in october so would n't advise visiting late in the year to be honest, spring time is your best bet.
do realise is quite expensive to visit ireland?
are going to need a few thousand dollars saved up for flights, insurance, food, accommodation & spending money.
eating out in particular is quite expensive compared to america believe.
have 4 golden wonder killifish.
the last one is colourful too but is about 4cm long.
feed them flakes, and live earthworms uncut everyday.
can tell me the whole process of breeding them and taking care of the babies?
if are able to take earthworms uncut, that is really impressive!
aspire to your feeding regime, flakes early and something live later in the day.
think that understand that your largest and smallest golden wonders are males.
if would like more on sexing out aplocheilus lineatus take a look at the discussion in the first source below.
if have plants in your tank.
('ve even had a pair of killies leave eggs on a floating thermometer!
if wish to pick eggs make a acrylic spawning mop.
prefer darker colors because can see their eggs ,more easily and the fish look better next to them.
if have the room to separate the male(s) & females(s),& feed them well on live foods, (assuming that are doing weekly 50% water changes) when put them together will leave a lot more eggs.
just making up examples, but if a pair is constantly together, may lay 10-15 eggs a day.
with extra blackworms and maybe frozen (defrosted, rinsed) frozen foods earlier in the day, may leave 30-40 eggs at a time.
separated and feed extremely nourishing stuff, may produce more.
also start the day with no nicks or dings in their fins.
also may need to treat the incubation water.
ironically sometimes is wise to leave the newly picked eggs in fresh tap water with some chlorination to kill microscopic critters that ride in with the eggs.
leaving a jar with a dozen black worms in it will sate the adult 's desire for snacks and are more likely to leave fry or eggs alone.
2. have kept up with partial water changes?
that indicates that thrive in different water chemistries.
still if can get your pet shop to do a hardness or tds (total dissolved solids) test, that may give you a hint.
include a number of minerals there and can figure out what percentage of that would be your hardness minerals (calcium, magnesium and iron).
ironically sometimes is wise to newly picked eggs in fresh tap water with some chlorination to kill microscopic critters that ride in with the eggs.
if get eggs in the mail in a medicine vial, that is fine.
after a number of people began complaining about "mystery deaths"among incubating eggs, some of the more advanced killie people began suggesting that after 7-8 days of incubation, should do a 100% water change - as the eggs develop, do release waste material.
if an egg turns blue, had died and then became dyed as the outer membrane broke down.
will be taking my 3 and 4 yr olds.
should get a balcony?
is vacation time.
look for fun filled, rejuvenating and memorable vacation.
especially if are planning to spend couple days with family and kids, which best suit can select?
do feel that the holidaying with the animated cartoons will impress only young ones?
whatever be the age, will have the choice of variety of activities to forget about your hectic day-to-day activities.
disney cruises offer 24-hour room services, and the crews are ready to serve you the way like.
has got very spacious rooms, furnished completely and neatly.
can spend many hours enjoying the disney world magic.
is really an entertainment for the kids.
can select the proper route and travel plans by consulting the agents prior to the booking........
would suggest a warmer season, but not spring break or early summer.
may also want to avoid thanksgiving week and the christmas holidays.
really enjoyed our balcony-- coffee in the mornings, drinks at night, standing outside when docking and leaving port-- however, is quite a bit more expensive.
with young ones, would definitely get a window or view room so can see outside.
check out the kids' space as soon as get onboard.
have a blast so the sooner get there, the sooner can have fun.
can also leave notes for the rest of your family (husband) about where are at any given point.
cell phones do not work on board but give you a 'walkie-talkie' kind of phone in your room that will work onboard.
always took ours to dinner and discussed what things felt 'had' to do and which ones felt like skipping in lieu of just chilling.
had a ball.
had an inside cabin and is what would recommend.
there are so many things to do that will only use your room for sleeping and the extra cost of the balcony is wasted.
the children can be checked in and checked out in a safe way at many activities so can have a bit of free time without the little ones.
will never be so spoiled in your life as are on a disney cruise.
if stay with your dining schedule, every night is dinner and a show.
the real payoff is that will have the same waiter for the entire cruise.
our waiter quickly grasped the fact that like ginger ale and rather spicy foods while my wife 's taste ran to lemonade and less spicy fare.
since knew our preferences, almost always went along with their menu suggestions and were never sorry did.
but food is always available and is consistently good.
think gained three pounds in my week long cruise.
that 's why 'm posting here!
posted this in singles and dating too, so 've just copied and pasted.
well, 'll try to make this short.
have known this guy for a long time, but 've never been good friends or anything.
is my farrier (shoes my horse s feet) so am technically a client if want to view it that way.
well, almost two weeks ago came out and did my horse s feet and was so flirty.
always hugs me when comes, but gave me at least 5 tight, long, back rubbing hugs while was there.
were also just talking about my horse 's crappy feet and mentioned.
"well, if ever just want to see me 'll come out and look him over and then can grab a coffee after."
that has never happened before so was kinda realizing at that point that was a little interested.
anyway, so ended up leaving one nail out of my horse s foot('ve never heard of a farrier doing this) and telling me to call him in a few days(first was a week, then was a few days lol) and 'd come back out and put it in.
do n't know if should call him again tomorrow or not?
know a lot of people say to wait until calls you, but 's different because 'm a client and technically that 's all am at this point.
's a father and son business.
anyway, would appreciate any insight on this at all.
thank you for reading if did! :)
ok, well as far as being a bad farrier for leaving a nail out - that is not the case, are extremely well known farriers in the area.
the reason said did n't put that nail in was because "didn't want to risk it" with my horse 's horrible feet.
this is about the fourth time 've done my horse 's feet because just switched back to them.
the only reason switched away from them in the first place is because my good friend who apprenticed with them was starting out on his own.
which, might add is the same foot that keeps crumbling with the nails.
so, obviously switched back to these guys.
ok, calm down, 's not like 's some stranger that came up and groped me lol.
've known the guy for about 10 years.
am 21, so yeah were both kids when knew each other!
is a few years older than me.
and yes, do like him.
to answer barry white, yes that did occur to me :) hope that is all 's waiting for.
on the other hand, could very easily just call me and say hey 'm busy right now, 'll call you when can come out.
and as far as scheduled visits go, have no idea.
've never done that before though either.
's always just "okay, they're feet need to be done, better call the farrier."
and usually come out within a few days.
will call you back m sure!
sounds like really likes you..
but need to ask yourself do feel the same way?
would like going for *coffee* with him?
or is not your type?
or are undecided?
if were you would go...
would say if does not call you back by friday call him again could be playing hard to get?
when was younger in my early 20s my farrier was a hottie named joby..( for those who do n't know am a girl read my bio on my page) dumb as a post about everything but horses..
sort a wonder what would have been like?
had this habit of telling you everything..
well one day said to me know do n't wear underwear as was bent over working on my mare s right front hoof.. and was like ummmm okay???
m glad his butt was facing me so could n't see my red face think my mare was even laughing..
well 6 weeks later when came back out was again working on my mare s front foot and looked down and yeah had wholes in his pants in the wrong places bust out laughing and was like what???
was like ummmm can see your ass cheeks... was like oops did forget my underwear???
that was a strange way to flirt.. but guss was his way...
was heartbroken.. but then realized was not the guy for me..
wow does sound interested in you, my farrier never gives me hugs like that (probably a good thing as has a wife and 2 kids) anyway, find that can be very busy so would wait a week lo9nger and if still no reply give him a call but do n’t leave a message so do n’t have to necessarily wait for to call.
from the point of view of a business, and client/operator relationships, 's doing a really shitty job.
leaving nails out so 'll call and have come back out later?
cute or not, 'd call a different bloke because 's doing a sub-par job at something needs to be doing his best at, whether 's flirting or trying to ask you out or not, ought to put quality first.
this is, after all, his business, and if wants you to remain a customer why on earth is doing shoddy work?
have the opportunity to pick up a super nice 6 year old for free.
's not lame, but 's been having issues.
have a 5 year old that lost all of his cheek muscle on the right side about 3-4 months ago.
chalked it up to possible nerve damage, because this is what the vet thought and the other cheek muscle was fine and had no theeth problems.
so sent him to the trainers the first of september to be started on the barrels.
got him back the first of the month and had lost some weight but attributed that to be worked everyday ( expected him to drop some).
can eat all his feed and does n't drop any, but can not eat hay from lack of muscle to chew it.
is gant looking in his flank area and is losing topline muscle.
the only neurological sign that shows is that barely drags his toes and sometimes has trouble with his right lead.
the horse had posted about a couple weeks ago with the atrophied cheek muscles is down to his last resort for life.
cannot afford to treat whatever is wrong with him.
no, have not done an epm test but have done an extensive blood panel and my vet did a neurological physical exam.
elected to not do the epm test because there was no neurological signs.
is still showing no signs other than the weight loss, and some muscle atrophy.
eats all of his grain but just takes him a while to get it chewed because of the lack of muscle in his jaws.
so might get the horse and see what can do.
will be getting with my vet first and if do get him, have the spinal fluid test done for epm and a titer test.
'll be having my equine chiro/acupuncturist out to do some work as well if do get him....
think should do it?
will be calling my vet and chiro about him.
worse comes to worse, 'm out of the $$ and have to put him down anyway or have a pretty pasture ornament.
's still rideable currently and not having many issues under saddle.
this is a horse that otherwise would n't be able to afford and even if spend 2k and treatment come out ahead of his purchase price.
posted what the owner as said in paragraph 2 & 3, that is not me to clarify.
is the one that ca n't afford to do anything else for him in case does n't recover fully.
can eat grain and already have a feed regimen in my head for the guy since ca n't eat regular hay.
do n't think will be hard to keep his weight up so long as can eat the grain.
am not going to go pick up a horse ca n't afford.
am willing to pull the epm test and treat.
will also be having my other vet up who 's a chiro & acupuncturist to evaluate him for wobblers.
july is when started to exhibit slight symptoms and the owner and vet originally thought was just some nerve damage from something in the pasture with no visible injury.
's only exhibited weight loss and some muscle atrophy, with the slight toe drag and a bit of trouble with the right lead (which could or could n't be related).
's not starving.
's dropping we
's not starving.
's dropping weight, but most of that came from being at the trainer s and being ridden hard for 60 days.
's not putting it back on.
know that have the possibility of treating him and still having to put him down.
at the same time do know people who have had horses come back successfully after epm.
know this is going to be expensive.
'm willing to give it a shot.
gallop, 've already read that whole site and been reading through research articles from the research colleges as well.
will have the epm test done before treating.
's actually one of the alternative therapies for epm
think is wonderfully responsible that are going into this rescue eyes open and are getting the opinions of qualified professionals (and a bunch of yahoos) before decide to take this horse on.
do think some y!a users need to work on their reading comprehension as ca n't comprehend how taking a horse in as a rescue and getting it qualified medical treatment is abuse.
worst case scenario fall in love and after spending thousands of dollars have to put the horse down.
is that something are up for?
if so go for it and 'll give you all the moral support can as figure out what is up.
is heartbreaking to try to bring a horse back and then have to put it down, but some horses are worth the risk.
if feel this guy is worth it then hope your vet can figure things out.
as to epm like shee said being in mi 've had to deal with it.
hauled the horse to windsor and got him treated there.
that horse returned to racing and did n't notice much difference.
've had a few since then, but none since our race horses began wintering in florida.
have no idea if that is related or farmers are doing a better job of clearing out opossums now because know opossums are carriers, but have n't had an epm horse in at least 10 years.
can say all of our epm horses were treated early when were showing mild signs like shee gave and all returned to racing.
might just be coincidence or the fact those great big trotters with those extremely long backs lost a bit of fine coordination to get those gangly bodies around those tighter turns.
do n't know.
msu does a lot of epm studies because of how common is here.
may want to see if can get in touch with their epm group and get this guy in a study.
know did lab work showing that strongid c used daily could help prevent epm.
believe have a real study testing the lab work in real world situations now, but may be sometime before those results are released.
another thought with this being a mosquito season from hell could be west nile?
let us know what decide to do.
hate to see talent get wasted, but honestly do n't think could take in a horse right now these issues.
personally think should just keep on walking by.
should have you chiro out before decide if want this horse or not.
if have a good repoire (which 'm sure do) with them, should be honest on if this horse is fixable to any degree... not really sure what want to do with him...
even if can figure out what is wrong with this poor poneh, there is always the chance for remission and then relapse so may have to do deal with again in the future.
could have had a blow to the head causing this atrophy?
was always like this?
or has occurred since birth.
also wonder if might have had a slight stroke?
think if can not afford to get him treated that should not consider him as a prospect.
who knows what the future might hold, and might be expensive?
do not go to this salon, especially if have to get your hair straightened.
did a very bad job with my hair and were extremely rude when went back to ask them why did n't work for my hair.
